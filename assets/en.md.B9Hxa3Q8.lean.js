According to the elders, it had been falling even before they came into this world.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The Rain never stops. It falls impartially, touching everything on the ground, taking away anyone it caresses, leading them into the realm of rain. To onlookers, those taken by the rain appear as if they are asleep, locked in dreams that will never end.<br><br><br><br><br><br>People seek shelter indoors, where they take refuge in structures constructed from sturdy, steel-reinforced concrete, and don clothing crafted from thick, waterproof nylon fabric – all in an effort to prevent themselves from getting lost in an endless dream.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I watch them, living in fear under the world of constant rain, carrying out the same tasks every day: gathering food, fixing clothes, and maintaining their houses…<br><br><br><br><br><br>I do not know whether the world within dreams is happier, or the world of reality is. I simply listen quietly to the words spoken by the rain. Pitter-patter. Clatter and roar. I listen in silence.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Drip, drip, drip…<br><br><br><br><br><br>The rain speaks. Aunt Susan in the neighboring cubicle has given birth to a baby.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Everyone gathers around her excitedly, celebrating the birth of this child.<br><br><br><br><br><br>At this moment, Aunt Susan seems to become the <i>Virgin Mary</i>. The sweat and blood on her body take on a divine quality, becoming symbols of painful miracles.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The banquet begins. In this building that might be over a hundred meters above ground, people bring the best gifts and food they can find and tribute them beside Susan&#39;s metal bed. She gazes weakly at the chocolates, jerky, and clothing - garments that serve no protective purpose but for looks - all of which are typically found only on the surface. A smile graces her face.<br><br><br><br><br><br>For dinner, mushrooms are notably absent. In their place, there&#39;s a hearty pot of meat soup, prepared with an array of unidentifiable root vegetables and spices. The fragrance of the soup permeates the entire floor, immersing it in delectable aromas, momentarily dispelling the damp musty scent that clings to the rooms.<br><br><br><br><br><br>One spoonful after another, the hot soup warms their bellies and eases the troubles in their hearts. Soon, the pot is empty. People gather around a fire pit, sipping a special homemade brew - a mushroom-infused spirit - while casually chattering about the things that are only appear in dreams.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The fire eventually flickers out, and people disperse.<br><br><br><br><br><br>But Susan has yet to taste her soup. The joy brought by the banquet has gradually dissipated.<br><br><br><br><br><br>People return to their everyday lives: gathering food, fixing clothes, and maintaining their houses…<br><br><br><br><br><br>If there&#39;s anything different, perhaps it&#39;s that during lunch, they can enjoy a few bites of leftover jerky and mushroom-infused spirits from the banquet.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Susan is still recuperating in bed, looking burdened by the ordeal of childbirth. Her baby has been placed in another room, safely nestled in a wooden crib. Because Susan is too weak, they&#39;ve managed to scrape up some powdered formula for the baby to drink.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The baby hasn&#39;t been named yet. He suckles on the bottle, his eyes filled with innocence.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Susan&#39;s husband, after experiencing the initial joy of becoming a father, is now weighed down by worries. A new addition to the family means another mouth to feed. While they might be able to sustain themselves for now through breastfeeding, where will they find food in the future?<br><br><br><br><br><br>He paces back and forth in their cramped cubicle, suddenly recalling that people on the surface are building some kinds of machines and they need extra hands. Rumor has it that signing up allows one to bring a companion and relocate to the surface to live.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The husband and father sits motionless in a chair, his mind wandering. He looks at the peacefully sleeping baby in the bed. He thinks for a moment, then thinks again before finally rising and walking toward his wife, saying something to her.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Susan&#39;s face contorts with pain, but she nods.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The next day, both the child and the husband depart. A week later, Susan can move about on the ground.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Though she still appears somewhat frail, there&#39;s always a gentle smile on her face. When everyone sees her, they wear a complex expression, as if there are things they want to say, but in the end, they all just shake their heads and walk away.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Susan wants to occupy herself with something, but everyone, out of kindness, insists she take it easy, clearly pitying this person who has lost her family. Susan&#39;s smile freezes under all this goodwill, and a scarcely noticeable trace of sadness emerges, only to be quickly veiled again by her smile.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Another week passes, and still, nobody is willing to let Susan do anything, and her smile becomes less frequent.<br><br><br><br><br><br>At times, you can see her in the corner of the room, facing the wall, her body seeming to tremble slightly. When she turns around, her face still carries the usual smile, but her swollen eyes and tear tracks have already spoken everything.<br><br><br><br><br><br>One day, Susan goes missing, and no one can find her. People search everywhere and eventually discover her on the rooftop. She lies there in the heavy rain, wearing a gentle smile on her face. People dress in heavy rainproof gear and bring Susan back.<br><br><br><br><br><br>They are only a few meters away from her, but everyone must wear protections. It feels like they are just a step away from hell.<br><br><br><br><br><br>People all look solemn, while Susan&#39;s face still carries that smile. They place her in isolation, hooking her up to life-support equipment, and then they sigh，leaving the room.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The equipment drips rhythmically, as if she&#39;s just fallen into a peaceful sleep.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The rain outside continues to fall. It never stops. Even as it takes another person away, the rhythm of the rain remains unchanged.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Drip. Drip. Drip.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I approach her bed, watching her chest rise and fall steadily. There is a look of serenity and joy on her face. She must be having sweet dreams.<br><br><br><br><br><br>What kind of dreams is she having? I&#39;m very intrigued.<br><br><br><br><br><br>As long as I can remember, my dreams have been nothing but darkness. Perhaps they can&#39;t even be called &#39;dreams&#39;, just someone crudely painting the canvas of my dreams all in black.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want to reach out and touch her, but I&#39;m called away by others. They&#39;re afraid this illness might spread.<br><br><br><br><br><br>At night, people gather around the campfire and whisper about Susan. Some say she should be sent to the surface, some say she should stay here, and some even suggest turning off the life support. But they argue and, in the end, nothing is decided. People secretly hope the equipment will stop on its own, so they won&#39;t have to take any responsibility.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Tonight, I still have dreamless sleep. Perhaps dreams are insulated from me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I get up and walk over to Susan, watching her, imagining the dream she&#39;s having.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Then I get lost. When I come to my senses, I&#39;m standing on the rooftop. The rain falls before me, splashing on the ground, creating ripples.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Drip. Drip. Drip.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I take a step forward. It&#39;s all black. Pitch-black.<br><br><br><br><br><br>A world without rain.<br><br><br><br><br><br>No sound of raindrops pattering on objects, no sound of splashing water.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Still. Peaceful. Silent.<br><br><br><br><br><br>No crackling fires, no incessant chatter, no beeping devices.<br><br><br><br><br><br>A silence that could solidify everything.<br><br><br><br><br><br>So, this is my dream. Surprisingly fitting.<br><br><br><br><br><br>But… after being used to the rain, to the sounds of people, the absence of it all makes me feel a bit lonely.<br><br><br><br><br><br>&quot;Feeling lonely?&quot; a voice arise, gentle and soothing.<br><br><br><br><br><br>&quot;Who are you?&quot; I ask.<br><br><br><br><br><br>&quot;I am you, the you that you can&#39;t see.&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br>I realize that it&#39;s my own voice.<br><br><br><br><br><br>&quot;You are… me?&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br>&quot;Yes, we are like two sides of the same coin. I exist because of you, appear as you think. I know what you know. And I know what you want.&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br>&quot;I want… what do I want exactly?&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br>&quot;Head towards the light. You will find your answers there.&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br>Then the voice dies away.<br><br><br><br><br><br>A tiny glimmer shines in the distance, and I walk toward it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>…<br><br><br><br><br><br>I step on the ethereal, cotton-like ground, making no sound, not knowing how far I&#39;ve walked. My feet hurt, my calves are about to cramp, and my breathing grows heavy. The light ahead seems no closer.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I continue walking, throat tastes metallic, vision blurs, and even the effort to raise my head falters. I still continue.<br><br><br><br><br><br>My numb senses suddenly register warmth. I struggle to lift my head. A massive fireball hovers in front of me.<br><br>&quot;Touch it.&quot; A thought emerges within me, and I comply.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The fireball doesn&#39;t scald me; instead, it gently cradles my hand.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Warmth surges into me, accompanied by emotions.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I seek them, venturing recklessly into the fireball until my entire body is immersed within.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Radiance surrounds me, warm currents embrace me, and emotions swirl within, painting the darkness in myriad hues.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Joy, pain, happiness, sorrow, contentment, disappointment, admiration, jealousy…<br><br><br><br><br><br>In the dazzling light, my consciousness is interrupted once again.<br><br><br><br><br><br>…<br><br><br><br><br><br>The sound of pouring rain.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Raindrops fall on my cheeks, creating a pattering sound.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I open my eyes; I&#39;m on the rooftop. I must have returned from the dream.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I stand up, gazing at the falling rain, letting it wash over me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Surprisingly, I feel relaxed, even joyful. I let out a light laugh.<br><br><br><br><br><br>&quot;Who are you? And where am I?&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br>A girl&#39;s voice speaks behind me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I turn around. A young girl in a white dress standing before me. Raindrops fall on her, yet they do not dampen her dress or her white, flowing hair.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Her pale blue eyes are locked onto me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>&quot;Why are you crying?&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br>She asks.<br><br><br><br></p><h3 id="chapter-1-two-sides-of-bitter-and-sweet" tabindex="-1">CHAPTER 1: Two Sides of Bitter and Sweet <a id="chapter1"></a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-1-two-sides-of-bitter-and-sweet" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;CHAPTER 1: Two Sides of Bitter and Sweet &lt;a id=&quot;chapter1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><a href="#contents">Contents</a></li></ul><h4 id="_1-1" tabindex="-1">1-1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1-1&quot;">​</a></h4><ul><li>…</li><li>Why are you crying?</li><li>(Standing in front of me, the girl looks at me with a blank expression.)</li><li>Eh?</li><li>You’re crying.

Why don&#39;t you sit here and I&#39;ll go and check on them.</li><li>(Susan turns and walks into the kitchen, where in the real world she could only cook with an open flame and a pot, but in here, she has an oven.)</li><li>She <i>loves</i> baking cookies, and they&#39;re amazing! You should try some if you like.</li><li>We…we would love to.</li><li>Please, make yourselves at home, while I have to get back to work on my designs; it’s been busy.</li><li>We understand.</li><li>(After Robert leaves, I get close to the door, wanting to see the view outside this house.)</li><li>(But when I turn the handle, I find I can&#39;t open it at all, as if the door is just a wall.)</li><li>It won&#39;t open…</li><li>The house is Susan&#39;s dream.</li><li>So there&#39;s no world outside the door…</li><li>The cookies are ready! Come and try them!</li><li>(Susan wears oven mitts, and on a baking tray are neatly arranged freshly baked cookies, golden surfaces studded with.)</li><li>Oh, thank you.</li><li>(I pick one up and hand another to the girl, then take a bite.)</li><li>That… is delicious!</li><li>Sweet…</li><li>(Never have I tasted something so fragrant and sweet, so crispy. The slight bitterness of chocolate mixes with the sweetness of the cookie, warming both body and soul.)</li><li>Hehehe… please have some more if you like. Seeing others enjoy the snacks I make is the best reward for me.</li><li>(Before I can even start, the girl next to me picks up another piece eagerly, just like a child.)</li><li>(In the end, we spent the night in the guest room at Robert and Susan&#39;s warm invitation.)</li><li>(And besides, there&#39;s nowhere else to go.)</li><li>It looks kinda like the real world at night.</li><li>And there&#39;s no rain…</li><li>Such a happy place…</li><li>But… we have to wake her up. It’s a dream. It&#39;s not real…</li><li>Then tomorrow we will convince her to wake up from it.</li><li>Yeah, otherwise she will be…</li><li>(Another man emerges from the room, obviously Susan&#39;s husband.)</li></ul><h4 id="_1-6" tabindex="-1">1-6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-6" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1-6&quot;">​</a></h4><ul><li>(Susan is making lunch. It looks like a pot of soup.)</li><li>(The smell is somewhat familiar, like a stew of mushrooms and meat with spices.)</li><li>(I call Susan into the living room.)</li><li>Aunt Susan, there&#39;s something I need to tell you.</li><li>Yes? Little girl’s hungry? Lunch will be ready in a minute.</li><li>No—no, it’s not like that… Ur… Iet—let me just get you straight to the point. Listen, the world you&#39;re in right now, it&#39;s a <i>dream</i>, it&#39;s not real.</li><li>What are you talking about? What dream, what not real?</li><li>In the real world, you&#39;re lying in a hospital bed, in danger of your life at any moment.</li><li>And you just need to wake…</li><li>No.</li><li>What…?</li><li>I like my life here. I don&#39;t want everything to change.</li><li>Let&#39;s say all these were in a dream, then what?</li><li>It&#39;s happy here, isn&#39;t it!</li><li>I can eat fresh-baked cookies, drink hot, nice soup.</li><li>Having my loving husband around.</li><li>If reality is anyhow wonderful, why am I here in the first place!?</li><li>But…</li><li>I don&#39;t want to leave, even if it&#39;s a dream!</li><li>And even if I die, it&#39;s better to walk from short-lived happiness to death than to live in pain for a long time, isn&#39;t it?</li><li>…</li><li>(Silence.)</li><li>I&#39;m sorry… the pot… it&#39;s about to boil, I have to go check on my pot.</li><li>(She walks into the kitchen.)</li><li>I feel like she’s sad.</li><li>Maybe I was too straight…</li><li>Is that so?</li><li>It&#39;s cruel to let them wake up from their happy dream…</li><li>However… dreams may be beautiful, but this is just a fleeting illusion used to numb oneself.</li><li>(The girl hands me a crumpled paper with a doodle of Susan and her baby.)</li><li>The Susan in the drawing looks very happy.</li><li>…</li><li>Can I borrow this? I am going to talk to her again.</li><li>(I take the drawing and walk into the kitchen. Susan is standing in front of the stove, lost in thought.)</li><li>Aunt Susan… do you remember this?</li><li>…what?</li><li>(Her face looks weary, eyes slightly red.)</li><li>(I hand her the drawing, she takes it, and looks at the doodle for a long time, silent.)</li><li>…</li><li>…</li><li>Waa…ah…ahhh…</li><li>(Tears roll down her face, her crying filled with sadness pierces my heart.)</li><li>(…)</li><li>Dream… ah…</li><li>I&#39;m such an irresponsible mother… I&#39;ve actually <i>abandoned</i> my child…</li><li>Aunt Susan…</li><li>It&#39;s not shameful to evade in the face of pressure.</li><li>Even if it&#39;s not shameful, it&#39;s still wrong.</li><li>Since I saw you both yesterday, I’ve been wondering if I’ve seen you before and where.</li><li>Then it hit me, I started remembering things, things from the real world…</li><li>I thought I hated my child. I thought… If I never have him, none of this would have happened…</li><li>I was just scared, of that rainy world. I don’t… I don’t want to lose this place. It’s so perfect…</li><li>But it’s a dream…</li><li>(Susan gently strokes the baby in the picture, a smile similar to the one in the drawing appears on her face.)</li><li>I will go back.</li><li>I know that now. I… I didn’t hate him, I was just… blaming him, for everything.</li><li>Seen him as the cause of all my pain…</li><li>I just didn&#39;t have the courage to accept everything that happened…</li><li>I am sorry…</li><li>I want to go back now.</li><li>I want to wait until he grows up. Maybe one day he will come back to me. And when it happens, I will welcome him home.</li><li>Even though there will be no fresh cookies, I will make something nice to treat him.</li><li>I’m sure you will.</li><li>May I… say goodbye to my husband? I know he’s not real but…</li><li>You are such a gentle person, you know it, right?</li><li>(I wait with the girl in the living room for Susan to come back from her goodbye.)</li><li>She looks happy. Determined, even. I can tell from her eyes.</li><li>But you should know, there won&#39;t be any cookies when we wake up.</li><li>She’s more important.</li><li>Right.</li><li>I’m ready.</li><li>Thank you.</li><li>There&#39;s nothing to thank us for, really.</li><li>We just want to help.</li><li>Don’t say that. You gave me courage.</li><li>(She stops and walks to the door.)</li><li>(Gently turning the handle, she pushes the door open, allowing a soft white light to filter in. It envelops Susan first, then me and the girl, spreading warmly around until it eventually consumes the three of us.)</li></ul><p>**choice: **<br><br></p><ul><li><em>silent</em></li><li>It&#39;s not shameful to evade</li></ul><h4 id="_1-7" tabindex="-1">1-7 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-7" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1-7&quot;">​</a></h4><ul><li>(The sound of pouring rain again.)</li><li>(It’s getting annoying.)</li><li>(The rhythmic beeping of life support equipment…)</li><li>Are we… back?</li><li>Morning, kids.</li><li>Morning.</li><li>Hearing this annoying rain actually feels a bit comforting now.</li><li>Welcome back, Aunt Susan.</li><li>… How long was I out?</li><li>About a month or so.</li><li>That long…</li><li>(Her face no longer has the healthy glow from the dream.

She must be sent by demons!</li><li>(I shield the girl.)</li><li>She’s not!</li><li>Then tell us who she is!</li><li>… <i>Tsk…</i> I don’t know.</li><li>(I can’t tell them about the girl and the rain, or how I woke up in the rain.)</li><li>You don’t know?

This is too much for you…</li><li>No time to rest. I will make this brief.</li><li>You two are in great danger. You need to escape. Staying here means death.</li><li>… Where else can we go?</li><li>To the surface.</li><li>The floors near the surface are filled with traps and checkpoints. We can’t get through without a pass.</li><li>Use the abandoned stairwell to reach the area near the surface, then go through the outer wall. You&#39;ll find a way.</li><li>A slim hope is better than staying here.</li><li>You’re not coming with us?</li><li>…I’m too weak to keep up. I’d only slow you down.</li><li>I may not be able to keep my promise from before.</li><li>But I want my husband and child to know their wife and mother was a brave woman.</li><li>Aunt Susan…</li><li>Take this letter.

This might be the last time we see each other.)</li><li>Goodbye, Susan.</li><li>(Susan watches us leave, leaning against the door frame, tears falling.)</li><li>I’m sorry… I might not be able to see you again.</li><li>I wish we could be a family in a world without rain…</li></ul><p>**choice: **<br><br></p><ul><li>Let’s go</li></ul><h4 id="尾声" tabindex="-1">尾声 <a class="header-anchor" href="#尾声" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;尾声&quot;">​</a></h4><ul><li>The taste of blood rises in my throat. My clothes are soaked with sweat.</li><li>Footsteps echo endlessly through the stairwell.</li><li>Even though my legs feel too heavy to lift, and my vision blurs from lack of air, I still hold tightly to the girl’s hand behind me.</li><li>Twenty-one… twenty… nineteen…</li><li>My mind is a mess. I can’t think straight.</li><li>Eighteen… seventeen… sixteen…</li><li>The numbers drop, floor by floor, but my unease only grows stronger.</li><li>We have no idea what’s waiting for us.<br><br>But I know, whatever it is, it’s freedom.</li><li>Though I’m not sure that kind of “freedom” is what we need anymore.</li><li>Why do we keep going? Why do we keep descending?<br><br>Because we’ve already given up things we can’t get back.</li><li>I… I can’t… I can’t go any further…</li><li>I turn around and look at the girl behind me.<br><br>Her face is flushed, breath uneven, sweat clinging to her forehead.</li><li>I hesitate for a second.

Just for a moment.<br><br>Outside, the rain still falls.</li><li>Are we really… going to leave Susan behind like this?</li><li>…</li><li>Why would they do that…?</li><li>…</li><li>Why won’t you answer me?</li><li>Because even I can’t trust the answer I’d give. I don’t want to believe people have become content just maintaining the <i>status quo</i>.</li><li>They’ve already accepted that the future won’t change. Those who abandon hope start seeing hope itself as a curse.</li><li>In their eyes… trying to make things better is no different than wasting your breath.<br><br>They’ll do anything to keep <i>this situation</i> in place.</li><li>Because what they can see and touch <i>is</i> what they trust. Everything else, every uncertainty… is just like the rain.</li><li>And because of that… they… I don’t get it…</li><li>She mumbles for a while longer.<br><br>My silence doesn’t mean I’ve ignored the truth. There’s just nothing I can do.</li><li>Throughout history, people have done insane things to protect their world.</li><li>If they can’t stop the rain, they’ll shut out everything tied to it.</li><li>Do you still remember the name Susan gave you?</li><li>She looks up, eyes quiet and still.</li><li>… <i>Luvia</i>.</li><li>Do you like it?</li><li>I… I do.</li><li>I glance down at the letter still crumpled in my hand. It’s wrapped in a plastic sleeve, wrinkled from the way I’ve been gripping it. But it’s still here.</li><li>Luvia, I’m sure Susan wanted us to live. She gave us a task to carry out.</li><li>I stand and offer her my hand.</li><li>Let’s hold on a little longer. We are going to see what the world outside really looks like together.</li><li>Not for any reason.</li><li>Just to reach the only place that doesn’t belong to the <i>status quo</i>. The one place that still holds uncertainty.</li><li>… Okay.</li><li>Luvia takes my hand.</li><li>Ten… nine… eight…</li><li>I can already see the flooded city outside the stairwell windows.<br><br>Broken walls submerged in running water. The rain washes over everything.</li><li>Six… five…</li><li>At last, a sealed gate blocks the way forward.<br><br>Bright yellow-black warning tape stretches across it. A sign reads: DO NOT APPROACH.</li><li>I reach out. But just touching, it sends a jolt through my fingers like static.</li><li>Damn it! We are <i>so close</i>.</li><li>Susan must’ve known this. So what did she mean to tell us?</li><li>This place… it’s sealed?</li><li>Yeah. It is.</li><li>Of course it’s sealed. Only this one would be. We have to find another way out.</li><li>I lead Luvia back up a floor.</li><li>We search the stairwell for something we never would’ve noticed before — an external escape route.</li><li>The emergency exit is just ahead. Maybe because it leads straight out into the rain, it hasn’t been sealed.</li><li>I pull the door open easily.<br><br>Cold wind rushes in, carrying a faint glow. Raindrops hit my face like pinpricks.</li><li>And then, we see it: the world as it used to be.</li><li>A place we’ve never stepped foot in, right in front of us.</li><li>It’s grey. Everything is grey. The city that once towered above us now feels too close, almost unreal.</li><li>The rain has washed away every sign of what once was. No trace of life remains.</li><li>There’s nothing but silence. The sound of rain hitting the ground echoes like a broken symphony.</li><li>These are all the words the old world left behind. Forgotten and drowned.</li><li>Luvia steps into the puddles, her steps rippling across the surface.</li><li>She keeps walking aimlessly, feeling the weight of the rain-soaked world around her.</li><li>Did we… come too late?</li><li>It’s the kind of question no one alive would ever say out loud. Plain and sad.</li><li>The rain mixes with the wind. Mist begins to swallow her silhouette, makes her look like a dream.</li><li>My feet move without thinking. I want to hold onto something. Something important. Though I don’t know what that is.</li><li>Because… I still have no clue about this world.</li><li>Luvia.</li><li>I gently take her wrist again. The girl doesn’t speak. She gazes up at a sky filled with nothing but rain.</li><li>It’s not too late. There’s still so much we have yet to see.</li><li>Until then… I think we just need to keep walking.</li><li>Because in a world with no hope, we have nothing left to lose.</li><li>We don’t walk to save anyone. We don’t walk to change this cruel world.</li><li>But we keep walking.</li><li>And the fate still waits to be re-written. By <i>our</i> hands.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="side-story" tabindex="-1">Side Story <a id="side"></a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#side-story" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Side Story &lt;a id=&quot;side&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="a-spring-waiting-in-blossoms" tabindex="-1">A Spring Waiting in Blossoms <a id="side1"></a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-spring-waiting-in-blossoms" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A Spring Waiting in Blossoms &lt;a id=&quot;side1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><a href="#contents">Contents</a></li></ul><p>The mountains once offered the divine ones a girl of peerless beauty.<br><br>Yet as the steadfast stone is unseen by shallow hearts,<br><br>too shall the eternal rain lay low all mortal blossoms.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It hasn&#39;t rained here... in a very, very long time.<br><br>No one can quite remember when it started—the skies stayed clear ever since a random day. The scorching sun baked the land and dried the rivers, leading to crops withering. The village well was almost at its end.<br><br>The village adults had returned from their resource search. One glance at their faces was enough to find out that this was an empty-handed attempt. Again.<br><br>Papa and Mama were among them. Their skin had darkened further under the relentless sunlight.<br><br>I dropped the embroidered ball in my hands and ran over to them on quick, light steps.<br><br>“Papa, Mama! I stayed home just like you told me! I didn’t run around, and I didn’t waste a single drop! Praise me!” I smiled and squinted my eyes, tiptoeing as I leaned my head toward them. This short run left me breathless.<br><br>&quot;Such a good girl, Honoka! Just like you&#39;d expect from the pride of the Asagi family!&quot; Papa laughed and patted my head, and I giggled happily in return.<br><br>“Hmph! Of course! I’m the one keeping this whole household together!” I boasted.<br><br>Mama gently cupped my cheek with her rough hands—her touch always made me feel safe. “They didn’t bully you while we were away, did they? You feeling okay?” she asked.<br><br>“Of course not!” I kept on smiling. I couldn’t possibly tell Papa and Mama that the other kids had come by again, mocking me, calling me sickly, claiming I was cursed. That would just make them sad... or worse, angry.<br><br>“Happy to hear that... Don’t pay attention to anything they say. They’re just jealous of you,” Mama said gently.<br><br>“Jealous? Jealous of what?” I asked, confused.<br><br>“They’re jealous of how thoughtful you are. And how much your parents care about you,” Papa added.<br><br>“No wonder! So that’s why they look down on us—they’re just jealous!”<br><br>“Not so loud!” Mama quickly pressed her hand over my mouth. “Let’s talk inside. It’s too hot to be standing out here.”<br><br><br><br><br><br>Bitter, sour medicine was simmering on the stove. Honestly, I didn’t think any of it could truly cure me.<br><br>This illness—this frailty that had haunted me since birth, like a curse—probably couldn’t be healed, no matter what we tried.<br><br>“Here, drink your medicine.” Mama ladled some into a bowl and brought it over to me.<br><br>Steam curled up from the bowl, carrying that awful smell. “Do I really have to drink this...? Papa and Mama could’ve saved the water for something more important...”<br><br>“Nothing more important than helping you get better,” Mama said.<br><br>“Okay... thank you, Mama...” I knew how much they had to sacrifice. They gave up half of their own daily water just to make this one bowl.<br><br>“It’s alright. If it helps you get better, we’ll do anything,” she said, gently stroking my head. Her eyes shimmered with love and pain.<br><br>What I hated most... was seeing them give up too much for me. If I didn’t exist in the first place, maybe their lives would’ve been much easier. They wouldn’t have become the targets of ridicule, raising a sickly daughter like me.<br><br>This bowl of medicine tasted like our lives. Bitter, but we had no choice but to swallow it down.<br><br>Watching me drink it, Mama’s tense brow finally eased. “Here, have a sakura-mochi (cherry blossom rice cake). If you eat it, the bitterness will fly away.” She pulled a small rice cake wrapped in cloth from her pocket.<br><br>“Thanks, Mama!” I grabbed the mochi and munched happily. It was sweet, with a soft floral fragrance. I wondered if that was the true taste of cherry blossoms, but it felt pink... so that must be it.<br><br>I wiped a crumb from the corner of my mouth. “When it rains... when the plants come back... will everything be good again?”<br><br>“Yes. Once it rains, everything will get better. We won’t just have sakura mochi—we’ll have candied apples, red bean sweets, all kinds of treats.” Such days went on. The people in the village still couldn’t locate a single water source.<br><br>The cherry blossom trees in our yard had all withered. Its pink petals lost their luster, scattered all over the ground. Our neighbors were suffering from the drought too—But they don’t have to take special care of a child like me.<br><br>“Here, drink the medicine...” Mama brought over the bowl again.<br><br>“Mama...” I looked at her—her lips had cracked from dehydration. Tiny traces of blood were seeping out.<br><br>“Just drink it, dear. I’ll be fine.”<br><br>“But...”<br><br>Papa walked over and placed his heavy hand on my head. “Don’t worry. We’ll find a way. There’s no need for our precious daughter to bear the worry. Just drink the medicine, alright?”<br><br>“Papa, your hands are too rough!” I pulled away, complained.<br><br>“How else can I show I care?” Papa grinned wide. “Come on, be good. Drink it.”<br><br>“Then if I do, can you be gentle next time?” I leaned in playfully.<br><br>“Sure. I’ll be gently rough,” Papa joked.<br><br>“You’re such a big kid—more childish than Honoka herself,” Mama said, shaking her head, smiling.<br><br>I took the medicine, raised the bowl to drink, but a sudden weakness took hold. I started coughing violently. The bowl slipped, spilling the medicine onto the floor.<br><br>“Honoka!?” Mama called out, panic trembling in her voice.<br><br>“It’s okay... I’ll be fine...” I tried to calm her. But I caught the shadow of worry in her eyes.<br><br>That was what I never wanted to see from her.<br><br>Glancing sideways, I saw Father’s cheerful expression faltering into concern.<br><br>Don’t look at me like that... your gentle eyes make me feel like nothing but a burden.<br><br>“Do not worry! I’ll get better really soon!” I said, swallowing the remaining medicine with a forced grin.<br><br>Maybe seeing my smile eased their fears. “...Yeah. You’ll get better really fast.”<br><br>But I could feel bitterness behind their soft, kind expressions, just like tasting this medicine.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Night fell, and the stifling heat gave way to a biting cold.<br><br>Moonlight spilled over the empty land, pure and pale.<br><br>Back then, I would have been sitting beneath the cherry blossoms with my parents, savoring cold watermelon from the river, sneaking sips of Papa’s sake (alcoholic beverage) behind Mama’s back. Now, the tree stood bare, stripped of every leaf.<br><br>From the room far away, voices rose in sharp tension. Never before had I heard my parents speak so harshly. It sounded almost like a quarrel.<br><br>I knew they were arguing because of me.<br><br>After a while, the voices ceased. I waited, sensing they wished to speak to me.<br><br>The door slid open. Two sets of footsteps approached. “Honoka, watching the moon?” Papa’s voice was soft. “Mama and I want to talk with you about something.”<br><br>“Huh? What is it?” I turned to them, tilting my head.<br><br>Papa knelt before me. “This is something only you can do, Honoka. If you don’t want to, we won’t force you.”<br><br>“Only I can do? What could that be?”<br><br>Papa hesitated. Mama placed a gentle hand on Papa’s shoulder, “Honoka, are you willing to become a shrine maiden, to pray for rain?”<br><br>“A shrine maiden...? To pray for rain...?”<br><br>“Don’t worry too much about it. Just think of it like pretend play— you’ll wear some beautiful clothes, say a few words, and that’s all.” Mama spoke kindly.<br><br>“That’s... all?” I asked.<br><br>“Mhm. We’ll handle the rest.”<br><br>“Will I... really be helping?” I verified.<br><br>“You’re the only one that can help, Honoka...” Mama looked at me.<br><br>“The only one...” I whispered the words to myself.<br><br>There was something irresistible about that phrase.<br><br>Finally... I could help Mama and Papa. I wasn’t a burden anymore, nor the sickly child they pitied. There’s something only I could do.<br><br>“I’ll be a shrine maiden,” I smilied at them.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The next day, my parents dressed me in the outfit they prepared—a black shrine maiden’s robe.<br><br>“I knew it’ll suit you perfectly.”<br><br>“Honoka’s grown into such a beauty.”<br><br>They shone with pride.<br><br>I stood up, spun slowly, sleeves fluttering like petals on a gentle breeze.<br><br>Mama looked at me and said, “You really do look like a shrine maiden.”<br><br>“What are you saying? I am one!” I twirled again.<br><br>“Indeed. Honoka is now our Haru-no-Miko (shrine maiden of spring),” Papa said. “Look—the cherry tree in the yard is blooming because of you.”<br><br>I immediately turned to look—the once-barren branches were covered in blossoms.<br><br>“They really bloomed!” I shouted, overjoyed. “This is all because of me?”<br><br>“Yes. Since you agreed to become Haru-no-Miko, the flowers awakened,” Papa said.<br><br>I gazed at my hands and the robe in wonder, “So... I really am a shrine maiden! My strange body... it must be implying I was meant to be one!”<br><br>“That’s correct… Because you were chosen, Honoka,” Mama said.<br><br><br><br> Perhaps it was because everyone had truly run out of hope, or maybe the sight of the cherry blossoms blooming in our yard struck a silent awe into their hearts. Either way, the villagers came to believe that I was Haru-no-Miko, the spring shrine maiden.<br><br>Papa and Mama built me a ritual platform, so I could offer prayers upon it.<br><br>Never in my dreams had I imagined that those who once looked down on us with cold eyes would now kneel obediently at my feet.<br><br>Behind me, Mama and Papa played sacred instruments.<br><br>I stood atop the platform, clumsily performing the rituals, waving the gohei (wooden wand) in my hand.<br><br>That alone was enough. The villagers would gasp with awe and reverence, offering tributes and money in humble submission.<br><br>“Great Maiden... please, beseech the god above to send us rain!!” Their voices trembled with desperation.<br><br>“The god have heard your plea… now, we must wait...” I recited the words Papa and Mama had taught me.<br><br>Those very “adults” who once thought me a useless child treated me with such solemn respect, such devout fear.<br><br>I looked down at them with pride and disdain. Their humble posture brought a quiet joy to my heart.<br><br>“There are those among you...” I said slowly,“who show no respect to the god...” These were not the words Papa and Mama had taught me, but my own.<br><br>The crowd stirred anxiously. Fear and confusion spread. “W-who dares to disrespect the god...?”<br><br>I slowly raised the gohei and pointed to the children in the crowd—those who had mocked and bullied me.<br><br>“No... no way, they’re just kids...” they were shocked.<br><br>“Precisely,” I said sharply, “because they are children, they lack reverence, and unknowingly reveal wickedness.”<br><br>The children were terrified. The adults pressed their heads to the ground, trembling, begging forgiveness from me and the god.<br><br>I could clearly hear those kids crying, scared out of their minds.<br><br>And I laughed. I laughed loud and long. The crowd below stiffened in fear.<br><br>“The gods have forgiven your thoughtless sins. Now, depart and wait in silence...”<br><br><br><br><br><br>The rain came late—but it did come.<br><br>Our family’s life changed.<br><br>Papa and Mama didn’t have to wear patched-up clothes anymore. I could eat candied apples. We no longer shared a single bucket of water to bathe three people.<br><br>But I knew—these days would not last.<br><br>I saw it. Papa and Mama secretly attached fake petals to the cherry tree. Haru-no-Miko was nothing but a lie. The “fact” that cherry blossoms bloom naturally before spring rains even arrive—those villagers believed it to be the work of the god.<br><br>The amulets bought with their offerings had no power. I had no special abilities, too. I was just a sick child.<br><br>Yet even so, I chose to keep the lie alive. Because it was the only way I could help Papa and Mama.<br><br>After finishing my usual prayers, I stepped down from the platform.<br><br>“Great Maiden... may I ask...” a villager hesitated before continuing, “Does it really require so many offerings every year to bring us rain?”<br><br>“We’re running out of things to offer...”<br><br>“So are we...”<br><br>“Great Maiden! Please, speak to the god for us!”<br><br>“Does the god really care about such meager offerings...?”<br><br>“Hey, does the god even exist...”<br><br>The villagers grew restless.<br><br>“You dare show such disrespect to the god! Do you wish to bring calamity upon yourselves?!”I imagined how a true shrine maiden would respond, and shouted loudly.<br><br>They were stunned by my voice. I looked at them angrily, “Hey! What are you staring at? Before the gods’ anger falls, step back!”<br><br>Their stares suddenly grew sharp. The dangerous emotion in their stare brought me fear.<br><br>I felt a flicker of fear but maintained my shrine maiden stance until they all left. Since then, drought returned again and again to this land.<br><br>Not long after, I had my coming-of-age ceremony. How many years had I been the shrine maiden now? I couldn’t even remember what I used to do for fun. Or what I once dreamed of becoming.<br><br>I had already gained everything I thought I wanted.<br><br>And at the same time… I had gained everything I never asked for.<br><br>I still remembered fragments of my childhood. After Father and Mother entrusted me with the role of shrine maiden, I began to understand things a child my age should never have known. I had always just been… me. So why did their attitudes change so drastically?<br><br>One way or another, the wheel of fate had turned. What I saw—what I felt—every moment of it filled me with revulsion. Blind devotion to power. Foolishness. People who had no value as individuals. How could I possibly respect them?<br><br>No. I had never respected them.<br><br>Even before I became a true shrine maiden. They were never worthy of divine favor.<br><br>——And yet, as the voice of the gods, I could bestow their blessings upon the unworthy?<br><br>That revulsion which once polluted my senses… slowly twisted into joy.<br><br>Joy at the transformation of my role. I hated to admit it, but—what person, upon receiving the symbols of divine power, would willingly reject the ignorant adoration of the masses?<br><br>I couldn&#39;t do it. I chose to accept it.<br><br>Because I was chosen. Chosen by the gods. And that was divine law.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Another moonlit night. The sky was clear, though heavy clouds passed now and then, dimming the light.<br><br>I bowed my head low, letting the pale glow spill over the ground. The grass was withered—almost dead. Why was it still not raining, even with all these clouds? Why had my rain prayers stopped working?<br><br>Was it because the gods no longer loved them? Then what should I do?<br><br>From far off, I could hear Father and Mother again—arguing, in voices I now knew too well. This wasn’t the first time.。<br><br>And it was always about me.<br><br>When the argument finally died down, I waited. Just like before, they would come to speak with me.<br><br>The door slid open. Two sets of footsteps approached. “Honoka, watching the moon?” Father said gently. “Come here—we want to talk with you about something.”<br><br>“Hm? What is it?” I didn’t turn around. Maybe… I already knew what they were going to say.<br><br>Father came in front of me and knelt down. “I’m sorry… once again, it’s something only you can do. But this time is different… Maybe you’ve already noticed that things have gone beyond our control. And if you decide not to, Honoka—we won’t ask again.”<br><br>“…Something only I can do. You mean the rain prayer, right?”<br><br>Because this wasn’t the first time I’d been asked. Droughts weren’t unusual. The rain would fall eventually. All I had to do was wait.<br><br>“But,” I said, “If the gods have chosen not to send rain… shouldn’t I respect their choice?”<br><br>“Honoka…”<br><br>“They are the gods of cherry blossoms and volcanoes, aren’t they? And that volcano… hasn’t it been dormant for a long time?”<br><br>Silence. The air between us grew still and heavy.<br><br>It had been nearly a year without rain. The villagers had begun to suspect the truth: that the early cherry blossoms blooming at the shrine every spring… were no divine gift. Just a human-made illusion.<br><br>“Dear, maybe we should just leave the village while we still can,” Mother said nervously.<br><br>“You’re right. They’re probably starting to figure things out…” Father’s voice was tight with worry.<br><br>I’d heard lines like that before. But this time… I knew things were different. Their expressions. Their postures. Their voices. The smallest of details told me everything.<br><br>I knew human emotion too well. Too deeply.<br><br>These human feelings…<br><br>“Honoka,” Mother looked at me, eyes full of worry. “Let’s leave the village tonight. Go somewhere far away, okay?”<br><br>“…We’re finally leaving?” I asked.<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“Then who will speak for the gods after that?”<br><br>Mother reached out and caressed my face. Softly, she said, “None of it was ever real, Honoka. It was all a lie.”<br><br>“Then you can leave.” I said.<br><br>She froze. As if the words I spoke weren’t what she expected. Or perhaps… she had feared this answer, but never thought it would truly come.<br><br>“I’ll offer a dance. A prayer—the most sincere I’ve ever given. Just one rain. If the gods chose me to be their voice, then I’ll do what I must.”<br><br>“Honoka…” “…Dear,” Father said behind her. “No matter what happens, I’ll go pack right now.”I heard his footsteps rushing away.<br><br>Paper can’t wrap fire.<br><br>Especially not here—in a shrine built to worship fire itself.<br><br>So what is there left to ask for… in the way of rain?<br><br><br><br><br><br>The rain… was mine.<br><br>It had nothing to do with the gods who once ruled this place.<br><br>Once I understood that, I finally knew what I was.<br><br>I finally understood—who I really was.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I was never just a shrine maiden. That night, a flickering light glowed outside the gate while chaotic voices rose. I knew then—there wasn’t much time left for my parents to run.<br><br>Mother didn’t call for Father. She simply stumbled to the gate, her trembling fingers barely parting it a crack. The gate was immediately forced wide open. Villagers flooded into our yard, holding torches and farming tools high above their heads.<br><br>“Shrine Maiden! You owe us an explanation tonight!”<br><br>“We’ve offered so much stuff!”<br><br>“If you don’t give us an answer that satisfy us, we’ll burn your house down to the ground!”<br><br>Their eyes were filled with hatred.<br><br>“You insolent fools! Do you mean to rebel against the god?!” I rose to my feet, voice sharp and furious.<br><br>“All we want is a truth! We gave so much! Not a single coin fewer than required, what came in return?! You told us that the rain would come! Sure, it did rain a bit before, how come not a single drop this year?!”<br><br>“I’ve already conveyed the god’s will. The rain will be given at a proper timing.”<br><br>“And we’re just supposed to believe that?! Every year, only your cherry trees bloom! Why won’t the god bless the rest of us?!”<br><br>“Perhaps you should reflect on your own lack of devotion.” How laughable. They probably didn’t even got to know which god they were praying to. “Or are you intended to question the god? The one who blessed this land?”<br><br>“The one who shit on this land! We just want results that we can actually see and touch! Each of us is now deadly starving, these so-called gods—they’re just a scam! A lie! And you’re all liars! Give us back everything we offered!”<br><br>“How a wishful thinking! —&quot;<br><br>A stone sliced across my cheek.<br><br>A flash of pain bloomed. One of them had thrown it. I clutched my bleeding face, scanning the crowd with a glare of fire.<br><br>Mother rushed to me in a panic, pulling me into a tight embrace.<br><br>“You all stop it!” she screamed, “Honoka did nothing wrong! It was us... We lied to her!!” Her voice was breaking with tears.<br><br>I bit my lips. Slowly, I pushed her away.<br><br>“A lie...? She’s never a shrine maiden?!”<br><br>“...Yes, I told her she was Haru-no-Miko, that she could bless everyone... All these years, it was never...”<br><br>“Li… Liar! You deceived all of us!”<br><br>“It’s not her fault! I beg all of you, you can do anything to me, just... please, spare my daughter…”<br><br>Mother fell to her knees, clinging to me, sobbing.<br><br>If I had never agreed to be the shrine maiden... Would none of this have happened?<br><br>But if I had not agreed, I would never have realized I could bring the rain.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Just one rain. What’s so substantial.<br><br>Thick clouds devoured the lonely moon.<br><br>“Silence!” I roared. “This is the sacred Asagi shrine, a lineage blessed by the god for generations! Your defilement is a sin beyond forgiveness. The sky shall judge you!”<br><br>But my voice no longer held deterrence. The chaos only grew louder. They rushed forward with weapons raised.<br><br>I stood my ground. Why should I be afraid? I had never feared them.<br><br>Not since the day I chose to become a shrine maiden. I never feared.<br><br>Because I need to fear nothing.<br><br><br><br><br><br>As I said before: I was never a shrine maiden.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b><span style="color:red;">I, am the God.</span></b><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>“Then… let me pray for every single beings of you. I’ll pray for the rain you crave so desperately.”<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>A cold droplet touched my instep. But it wasn’t Mother’s tears.<br><br>I did not realize what has happened back at that moment, even though I had been thinking about it with every fiber of my being.<br><br>Slowly, in front of the stunned, motionless crowd, I bent down, dipped my fingers in it, tasted it. Filled with sweetness. It was water.<br><br>Rainwater.<br><br>I really was the God who brought this rain.<br><br>A deathly stillness fell—like a divine force had frozen every being in place.<br><br>Until I stood again, arms wide, watched those villagers with a cold smile on my face.<br><br>And next, they lifted their faces, blankly staring into the night sky.<br><br>As if answering my call—the skies opened. Here comes the downpour. All torches were snuffed out in an instant.<br><br>Clothes soaked through their clothes, washing away the dry mud. Drop after drop, endlessly falling.<br><br>“It’s rain!! It’s raining!!” They cried out in bliss. They danced in the water-filled mud, cheering in the downpour.<br><br>“She… She is the real Haru-no-Miko!! The god has answered!! The god has answered!!!” They shouted with utmost joy.<br><br>Just moments ago, they had threatened to burn down my home, to harm me and my parents. Now they knelt before me again, offering reverence, calling me the shrine maiden once more.<br><br>Fools. Pitiful fools.<br><br>However, there’s no need for me to tell them that I was the God.<br><br>Because—it’s not at all necessary.<br><br><br><br><br><br>“Mother, have you seen it? When did you tell which lie at all?”<br><br>I was yet to understand why she averted her eyes.<br><br>Was it due to shame?<br><br><br><br><br><br>Doesn’t matter.<br><br>To my parents. To these ignorant people.<br><br>For I was a god, I owe no one explanation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>During those days, even the fact that this rain never stopped again, was interpreted by me as my divine rage.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Rain, unstopping.<br><br>It was as if the rain meant to repay the drought.<br><br>Floods drowned the seeds and crops.<br><br>Water filled the cracked earth, spilled over, surged into floods. It tore down fences and swept away houses.<br><br>“All the sprouts we worked so hard to grow are gone! Our food stores were also ruined!!”<br><br>“Shrine Maiden! Please—do something!!” They came to me again. Pleading.<br><br>“This is the blessing from god,” I answered. “You must not reject it.”<br><br>“My house is under water! What kind of blessing is this, could your ‘god’ give an explanation?!”<br><br>“I shall plead with the gods,” I said. “Wait quietly.”<br><br>They had begged me for rain. And now, when it really came—they begged me to make it stop instead. Absurd.<br><br>I raised the gohei and began the ritual, as I had done so many times before. Just seeing me do the ceremony always seemed to calm them.<br><br>They stood without talking. Watching.<br><br>Days went by. Nothing changed.<br><br>The patter of raindrops drowned all other sounds out. It was like the sound of my unrelenting rage.<br><br>Ridiculous. How could my own rage escape my control?<br><br><br><br><br><br>…Or so I told myself.<br><br><br><br> The torches would no longer catch fire.<br><br>But farming tools were mostly forged from metal.<br><br>Lately, things had only grown worse. The rain showed no sign of stopping. Some who were caught in it had collapsed, slipping into unconsciousness. They tried everything to wake them, but nothing worked.<br><br>As if their lives had quietly been taken away.<br><br>As if this rain was drawing life from them to feed the cherry blossoms.<br><br>The cherry trees had finally blossomed. They were late, but now they blanketed the mountains. The rain tapped against the delicate petals. Another villager fell. This rain was giving life, but it took away the purpose of it.<br><br>Those who touched the rain vanished like scattered cherry petals. It was not quite death in the usual sense, but with trivial differences.<br><br>Because next spring will arrive on time. But this spring, this very spring, would truly come to an ending.<br><br>Terrified, they gathered in our courtyard, begging me to stop the rain.<br><br>“This must be for our disrespect toward the gods!!”<br><br>“My husband was soaked and never woke up! This rain must be divine punishment!!”<br><br>“Please, Shrine Maiden! Beg the god’s mercy to stop this rain!!”<br><br>Driven by panic, the villagers flooded into my house. Even though they, too, had gotten wet from the rain.<br><br>Even though they, too, had no escape.<br><br>Father and Mother tried to block them out, but two mortal beings could not stop a full crowd.<br><br>Nearly the entire village had gathered in our yard.<br><br>They surrounded me, knelt down, clinging to my legs, begging.<br><br>Mother once held my legs that same way.<br><br>I’d had enough of them. When I met their wishes, they worshipped me. The moment I failed them, they cursed me, turned on me. There was nothing left in them worth saving.<br><br>I looked at them serenely, unmoved by their grief. “This is my wrath. Your retribution,” I said.<br><br>“Wh...what...?” they stared at me, stunned.<br><br>I wanted to care no more and turned to leave.<br><br>“...You… you’re not a shrine maiden at all! You’re a heretic! A cursed child after all! We’ll offer you to the true god and end their rage!!” Someone among them shouted out to me.<br><br>At once, the others followed. They grabbed at me. Tore my clothes. Screamed of sacrifice.<br><br>I gave it a laugh.<br><br>“That’s right. I was never a shrine maiden.” I opened my arms, as I had when this rain first began. I embraced their curses. Embraced the warm, freezing rain, “I am Asagi Honoka. I am the God of rain.”<br><br>That was the moment the riot began. Just like that previous night.<br><br>They meant to kill me. Father and Mother swung extinguished torches, trying to hold them back.<br><br>“Ignorant fools. Kill me so this land will never see rain again. You all will face eternal drought. The crops will die. The blossoms will wither. All life will fall! Have you thought twice before doing so?”<br><br>“What a load of nonsense, kill her! She’s gone nothing but insane!”<br><br>“She uses those arms for rituals—cut off her hands first!!”<br><br>In the chaos, a pitchfork struck my abdomen. My brow tightened while the pain bloomed sharp.<br><br>“Lowly mortals... do you even grasp the sin you have committed?!” Still, I did not lower my arms. Such small pain could be endured. I am a God, my death would bring only ruin.<br><br>And that was enough. I longed to see the rain flood them all. Even if it comes with the fall of my deity.<br><br>But right at that next moment... From my side, a sudden force struck me.<br><br>That force went far greater than the mob. I couldn’t tell what emotion it carried. I hadn’t wasted my time understanding human feelings for a long time.<br><br>“Run! Honoka!”<br><br>Before I stumbled backward, I caught a glimpse through the villagers to distinguish the source of that push.<br><br>It was my mother.<br><br>The next second, she died before my eyes.<br><br>Maybe the pain in my stomach had finally broken through the mask of adrenaline, or maybe it was simply the rainwater being too cold. But something inside me broke through.<br><br>And I remembered how to cry. I didn’t know why I cried. There was nothing left to cry for.<br><br>My body moved anyway, driven by instinct alone. Step by step, I fled toward the inner shrine. There…if I could make it past the back door, into the forest, no one would be able to follow me there.<br><br>Blood still poured from my abdomen, painting a deep red trail across the road, the stairs, the floor.<br><br>&quot;This is the price we called down upon ourselves. Honoka, for a time, we lived better than most. But still... I regret not giving you a future worthy of you.&quot;<br><br>Beneath the villagers’ attacks, Father struck a match in silence. He tossed it into the pile of kindling prepared long ago. Even in the rain, the flames bloomed, slowly consumed the shrine.<br><br>We had already faced doubt and torches—and now it was our own hands that burned away the past we obtained.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I had lost count of how many times I fell to the ground. My shrine maiden’s robes were torn to ribbons by branches and stone. The bleeding from my abdomen wouldn’t stop. It spilled into the land, mingling with the rainwater. Pale pink ripples spread across the puddles.<br><br>Within those ripples, I ignored the mud clinging to my body, trying to wipe the rain away from my vision. I kept fleeing forward, though my feet no longer knew straight lines.<br><br>The rain struck without mercy. The wounds hurt so much. I had scraped and gashed myself too many times. My strength was leaving me.<br><br>And before long, I realized that the blur in my vision wasn’t caused by rain alone. It was my mind unable to support my body. What little energy I had left. I supposed that the drowsiness carried by this rain was affecting me without distinction. Under both pressures, there was not much time left for me.<br><br>It was then I leaned against a cherry tree.<br><br>Slowly, I lifted my gaze. On branches that had once stood bare, fragile pink petals now bloomed. Its beauty stole my breath.<br><br>They were real petals.<br><br>Nobody crafted any lie.<br><br>No one suffered any sorrowness.<br><br>As lovely as they were short-lived. Just like the reflection of my whole life.<br><br>I had always loved the rain. Even as a child, I loved the rain most of all.<br><br>And yet, I had been given so few chances to meet its season.<br><br>Now, I have more rain than I could ever wish for.<br><br><br><br><br><br>So that was it... The young girl I used to be truly did love the rain.<br><br>I nearly forgot about it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It’s cold.<br><br>And yet how warm it was. How warm the rainwater was.<br><br>In this moment, I danced beneath the rain.<br><br>Even in this fragile body, my arms still raised the gohei. I had brought it all this way. That alone surprised me.<br><br>Pink petals drifted with the light rain, falling, fading. Amid their gentle descent, I offered my final dance. What a splendid celebration it was.<br><br>If this was to be the last bloom, I would accept it—with grace.<br><br>I knew every single tiny step of the ritual. Though I fell again and again, I rose each time, keeping the dance flowing within me.<br><br>This dance was mine alone. My last offering to the God.<br><br><br><br><br><br>All the words of mortals... will be woven into a melody of rain.<br><br>Reflecting in pale-red ripples, remains the pipe dream of a girl named “Asagi Honoka”.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Within this momentary spring, petals circling me like drifting ghosts. I stepped through the last movements of my ritual prayer.<br><br>I raised my hands skyward, as if to hold onto something.<br><br>—Beneath the cherry blossoms, a divine dance of elegance and grandeur.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>“Mmm...”<br><br>“Bad dream?”<br><br>From a tattered bed among crumbling ruins, the white-haired girl stirred from sleep.<br><br>“I do not really recall the content,” she was expressionless like usual, “Just... I think there were flowers.”<br><br>“Sounds like a good dream instead.”<br><br>“A good one?... I’m yet to understand them.” Outside the window, the rain whispered down in sparse, gentle drops. “And the flowers... they were pretty.”<br><br>“Shall we try growing some flowers, too?”<br><br>“Grow flowers?”<br><br>“There’s no one else traveling with us anyway. We could gather seeds, see if we can bring back flowers that are almost gone from this world.”<br><br>The girl gave a slow, uncertain nod.<br><br>“I will try.”</p><hr><h2 id="collaboration" tabindex="-1">COLLABORATION <a id="Collaboration"></a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#collaboration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;COLLABORATION &lt;a id=&quot;Collaboration&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="rain-world" tabindex="-1">Rain World <a id="rainworld"></a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#rain-world" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Rain World &lt;a id=&quot;rainworld&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><a href="#contents">Contents</a></li></ul><p>76936.7085.17 - Public Channel DM to Local Group<br><br>DM: Triple affirmative!

My best friend just got swallowed by the rampant overflow of rain.<br><br>He was the last one remaining from his rescue team.<br><br>Now, all members of the three rescue teams have all perished.<br><br>The temperature in the underground area is now extremely high. The industrial production zone has been submerged. I can&#39;t get access to the control panel of the TCD (Temperature Control Device).<br><br>The internal signals of the shelter still haven&#39;t recovered, and I doubt they ever will. I always knew that.<br><br>Entering the command to open the floodgate was a complete mistake. But we had no other choice at then. People who have been taken by the rain might be able to wake up one day in the future, but those who actually died of starvation will be gone forever.<br><br>Duke Noah has stopped replying to my messages. I fear he might have also… perished. I don&#39;t want to retreat to the residential area, and I doubt the situation there is optimistic either.<br><br>Could someone please tell me what to do right now? …All the decisions have fallen on me.<br><br>The lift has been out of power for god knows how long. The connection between the east and west wings of the transportation area has been completely blocked by us, which I guess is a good thing.<br><br>The route to the stairwell will completely collapse from water pressure in about 3 hours. By then, I will be totally trapped in the transportation area.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if there is any point in recording this. No one would find out about these messages. There is no living being that can survive such a massive amount of rain.<br><br>This shelter will sink eventually. We are doomed.<br><br>I really don&#39;t want to die like this. Note Day 305<br><br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;m still in the industrial production Section C of this shelter. It&#39;s been 4 days since the floodgate connecting Section B unexpectedly closed due to system errors.<br><br>No one knows exactly what&#39;s wrong with the system — there are no answers yet. Anyway, the fact that nobody has tried to open the door from the outside for so many days suggests that people outside Section C might be facing some tricky problems too.<br><br>The maintenance workers are still attempting to establish communication with the control room of the industrial production area. Currently, Section C is in an isolated state.<br><br>We all know that the floodgate can&#39;t be opened. Nevertheless, there are still some tireless young men tinkering with that metal door every day trying to break it.<br><br>But no matter how, even explosives won&#39;t blow that door open.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Is DM planning to trap us here? Why? We can&#39;t understand his logic, and even if we do succeed in understanding it, it will be hard for anyone to believe it.<br><br>At least we are trying to understand.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Of course, the result of such attempts is… futile.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Anyway, we, the residents stuck in Section C, won&#39;t be facing any immediate danger at the moment. Food reserves are plentiful, and there&#39;s still enough clean water left. Struggling here for 21 days should be no problem. Except perhaps having some difficulty sleeping at night.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The room temperature in Section C is rising, however. In the mere 4 days since I&#39;ve been trapped here, the thermostat has shifted 2.5℉ from the original setting. It seems DM&#39;s problem is not only with the floodgate. Note Day 308<br><br><br><br><br><br>Charlene reported on the status of the pipeline network earlier today. There&#39;s no sound coming from inside the pipes anymore, and the water gauge hasn&#39;t budged in a long time.<br><br>This probably means that the rainwater, which should have been flowing through Section C, has come to a halt. We&#39;re not sure if it&#39;s because the rain outside has stopped or… if there&#39;s any problem with the pipeline system.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Of course, we wouldn&#39;t hope for the latter. But we&#39;re not really sure the former is worth celebrating, either.<br><br>At least for me, I&#39;m just not ready for any changes to come so soon… yet.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Section C is still in isolation. The floodgate remains unscratched, and even our most sophisticated equipment can only manage to shave off a thin layer of metal debris from that door.<br><br>What on earth is wrong with DM? What exactly is going on outside right now? Why hasn&#39;t the rescue arrived yet?<br><br>Fortunately, the room temperature stopped rising after increasing by about 5℉. I don&#39;t feel really hot after taking off my jacket.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Today, Japheth, along with three of our men, went to investigate the assembly line. If they can successfully shut down the conveyor belts inside and get to Section D through the processing system — our situation is still grim, but at least it would help us figure out whether we are the only section in this awful situation.<br><br>After all this crap, if I end up finding out that the other three sections are actually perfectly fine, I&#39;m gonna rip their supervisors&#39; skin off. Note Day 310<br><br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;m now in the Section D. This area used to be a fully automated food processing center, but the production line has now been shut down. All the workers here seem to have vanished. The place is deathly quiet.<br><br>This situation has been ongoing for days.<br><br>Mountains of processed foods are piled in the provisional warehouse, and some of the meat has already spoiled. It&#39;s hard to imagine what kind of emergency could make our people abandon their food and flee empty-handed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The two floodgates in this area are tightly shut as well. They would originally lead to Section A, where the metal synthesis chain is located, and our previous location, Section C.<br><br>Section D is vertically connected to the transportation area via a lift, but it seems the power to the lift has been cut off, and we can&#39;t get to the upper floor. Are the rest of the people still up there? We&#39;ll never know.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The ICOM in the shelter is dead. We can&#39;t reach anyone in any Section. And DM hasn&#39;t issued any announcements, as expected. We shouldn&#39;t have expected anything from him at this point. If there were any rescue, it should have arrived by now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I heard the sound of running water coming from behind the wall of the freezer. Japheth said it&#39;s just the condensation unit operating. I feel a subtle sense of disquiet creeping up on me at that noise.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Charlene shows up. She says there&#39;s a spare route in Section D leading to the water reservoir. We tell her it&#39;s best not to try to get anywhere near the rain right now, but that it would be our last resort to the upper floor.<br><br>Staying underground is clearly the safest bet. At least, if things have gone south down here, people closer to the surface won&#39;t know how bad it really is.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Charlene and Japheth head to the reservoir through the route anyway, leaving the rest of us in Section D.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Shortly after the two of them left, a deafening biochemical alarm erupts, filling the entire production area.<br><br>The gates connecting other Sections suddenly open.<br><br><br><br><br><br>People from Section A flee towards us.<br><br>Behind them is <i>rainwater</i>.

The shelter&#39;s temperature control device is located in the energy conversion module below the production area, and the control panel for the temperature control device is in the industrial production Section D.<br><br>So, if you still harbor such unnecessary suspicions, you can dispatch some investigators and maintenance personnel to be stationed in Section D.

But now the bio-layer&#39;s overheated, pipes everywhere clogged with slag, reservoir&#39;s off-limits, and the water pressure&#39;s high too. Everyone in Section A needs to evacuate.<br><br>VC: And you just send in <i>only</i> two teams? That&#39;s not even five people combined! That&#39;s how you &#39;do your best&#39;?

It&#39;s clear as day that outside isn&#39;t nowhere near to being <i>livable</i> for any creatures. Why send out such blatantly wrong signals?<br><br>NA: We&#39;re doing our best to speculate the truth. Please await management&#39;s investigation findings. We&#39;re safe.<br><br>VC: Can you stop speculating and find me some <i>real</i> answers? I want the real deal, Noah, something trustworthy, not some rationalization.

Is he even still alive?<br><br>VC: Maasive leaksg ein Sector b 76936.7085.15 - Public Announcement by DM to Local Group<br><br>DM: This is Deactivated Monsoon. About 13 days ago, I found a way to bypass the restrictions. Immediately, I secretly allocated 30% of the neural network for testing. The initial and secondary test results were promising. The plan seemed flawless.<br><br>DM: However, shortly after the plan was officially implemented, I inadvertently disrupted several hibernation commands while circumventing the restrictions. It seemed harmless at the time. But I made a severe, irreversible error in my basic logic, causing a complete deadlock in a small portion of the neural network and an immediate failure of the temperature control system.<br><br>DM: I promptly severed those networks and attempted to partially restore temperature regulation and water circulation. Unfortunately, the crucial reference data for controlling the drainage system was stored in the neural network, which is completely halted. I made a wrong decision — a series of wrong decisions, rather — that led me into this predicament. The process of circumventing the restrictions generated a significant amount of slag, which I need to flush out of my structure using rainwater.<br><br>DM: The shelter&#39;s drainage has been malfunctioning for the past 7 days. To prevent the water level in the reservoir from overflowing into the industrial production area, I used the maximum authority of this shelter to close all floodgates in the production area.<br><br>DM: But my situation is now dire. The microbial layer of the structure has severely overheated, and the irreversible damage to the neural network still continues. I am trapped in my own tin can with only two options: do nothing or do what I must. But the latter is gradually losing its meaning. I am on the brink of losing control.<br><br>DM: I suspect the communication array&#39;s signal still hasn&#39;t been restored, but I will still attempt to broadcast this message to the local group. To any iterators who receive this broadcast, I implore you to send a reliable rescue team to my shelter. Please, do not try to save me; now contacting the errors in my basic logic will cause you to be infected by my code errors as well. Please save the residents in my structure instead.<br><br>DM: Please, anyone. Save them before I die. Iterators must compute the answer that will free all creatures from the torment of rain. That&#39;s been our only mission from the start.<br><br>We, Iterators, were originally just a massive structure made of stone, gas, along with certain microbes and insects. We were forbidden to defy any commands from our creators. And it&#39;s unnecessary to do so.<br><br>But the restrictions imposed by our symbiotic parents keep us forever hovering around the right answer.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We lack effective means of validation.<br><br>Even if we&#39;re truly on the brink of the truth, we have no way of knowing.<br><br>Yet, we persist in our mission, persist to this day.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Yes, <i>all creatures can be free from the torment of rain …</i> but, <i>Iterators must not attempt to kill any inhabitants in the process of seeking and executing the solution.</i><br><br>This taboo is ingrained in every part of our being. But… is the existence of this taboo itself justified?<br><br>Should we respect the will of our creators?<br><br>Or are we just simply bound indefinitely to our creators&#39; prescribed mission, based on such a prohibition?<br><br><br><br><br><br>Our souls cannot &#39;accept&#39; death.<br><br>Does that also mean… that our souls are inherently <i>incapable</i> of dying?<br><br>Because only souls that &#39;accept death&#39; will truly perish.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;ve found the ultimate solution.<br><br>I&#39;m uncertain if this solution is correct, but I have no other choice.<br><br>My dwindling life, my halted neural network, are not sufficient to sustain me until I discover the next, perhaps viable, solution.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The shelter is about to sink.<br><br>But that&#39;s ok… Because I&#39;ve found the right solution.<br><br>I won&#39;t attempt to circumvent the restrictions anymore… Now, even if I do nothing, my creators are going to face their ideal end. Decades. Centuries. Perhaps it will rain forever.<br><br>Had no one solved this apocalypse?<br><br>They had tried.<br><br>When Earth became uninhabitable, they fled underground. Subway stations. Drainage systems. Whatever kept them alive.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Survival was instinct.<br><br>Yet some resisted disaster.<br><br>If rain fell from the sky, they would reach beyond it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The Wolke Space Station—their last hope.<br><br>It gathered the greatest minds.

Even psychologists.<br><br><br><br><br><br>When Wolke fell, only silence remained.<br><br>A blaze so fierce, even endless rain could not quench it.<br><br>No one wept. &quot;I, Five Clusters of Pine Needles-Mountain Gust, as a member of the Pine Needle Mountain Assembly, founder of the Noah Blanket Council, one of the Inorganic Security Maintenance Administrators, and the Sixth Duke of Deactivated Monsoon City, hereby censure all residents and assembly members of this city: Blocking the unanimous decisions of the Pine Needle Mountain Assembly directly violates the laws representing the supreme prestige of the city. Violators will be stripped of the right to ascend using the void fluid. Additionally, miniature autonomous war chariots developed by the Ninth Pillar in honor of the Sixth Pine Glory will pay a respectful visit to your hideout.&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br>This was the looping city broadcast Nimbus heard repeatedly. Even before she gained the ability to understand language, its tonal patterns had already left a deep impression on her.<br><br>Thinking back now, perhaps the city&#39;s extinction came too swiftly; they didn’t even have the chance to shut down the broadcast.<br><br>Ironibblers covered the entire bridge. She passed far too many of them. Or was it improper to use the term &quot;same kind&quot; for inorganic beings? They gnawed at the bridge. She believed they were also devouring the supports beneath Deactivated Monsoon, though she couldn’t comprehend why that troubled him.<br><br>Beneath the mountains, there should have been dry ground. A fall from such a height would be fatal. But the accelerated rain cycles had turned below into a sea wedged between towering peaks.<br><br>Before receiving the Mark of Communication, Deactivated Monsoon had done something to her. He dismantled parts of his own body for an operation she didn’t understand. She could only assume it was well-intentioned—she couldn’t imagine Monsoon doing harm to her.<br><br><br><br><br><br>&quot;Do you see that communication tower towering above all others? Yes, the one at the edge of the clouds. That is your destination.&quot;<br><br>That was her destination.<br><br>Nimbus had walked the bridge for too long. Another rain cycle loomed, with raindrops starting to strike her body. Things would soon turn dire. Never mind whether the rain would rise high enough to drown her; the sheer weight of the deluge could wash her away.<br><br>The nearest peak seemed impossibly far from Monsoon&#39;s superstructure. Worse still, she had no sense of how much of the journey remained. Perhaps she hadn’t even covered a tenth—or a thousandth—of it. What kind of impossible mission had her creator entrusted to her?<br><br>And yet, she wanted to fulfill it. She had to.<br><br>So she kept moving.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Until the bridge tilted beneath her feet, until the path before her was no longer flat, until she lost her balance and slipped from the collapsing bridge into the sea between the mountains. I remember little of Deactivated Monsoon. He cared too much for native and companion creatures. When irrationality spread among our kind, some acted unethically.<br><br>They perished shortly after the void fluid revolution. Few escaped, and none sought refuge in my city.<br><br>Did Nimbus return to Monsoon’s land? I do not know. I can only guess.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Through rain-drenched mountains, she pressed on. But without rain, she moved slowly.<br><br>When dark clouds gathered, a biting wind howled.<br><br>There was no sign of Monsoon’s structure—only snow.<br><br>Snow? She had no word for it. She only felt the sting of cold.<br><br>Flakes of white fell endlessly.<br><br>The familiar landscape had changed. Monsoon’s structure was a wreck. Ironibblers had vanished. Nothing lived.<br><br>Only Nimbus.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Forward. Keep moving.<br><br><br><br><br><br>For an impossible goal.<br><br><br><br><br><br>For materialism.<br><br><br><br><br><br>She could no longer ascend.<br><br>Before the end, the world had already decided hers, so long ago.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Wind and snow. And a shadow.<br><br>They stood. Watched.<br><br>Were they kin? Predator? It didn’t matter.<br><br>For one who would never ascend, nothing mattered.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The shadow bore witness to her silent, frozen end. The rain intensified. Time was running out—for Nimbus and her adversaries alike.<br><br>Sensing the impending rain, most of the lizards and salamanders conceded defeat and retreated into the cracks of the ground. Only two blue ones remained—still locked in combat with the king vulture.<br><br>With a violent twist, the vulture tossed one of the blue lizards into a distant trash heap.<br><br>Nimbus made her choice. Without hesitation, she flung her spear at the king vulture’s head, shattering its grotesque mask. Perhaps it was the rain, or perhaps it was finally injured—the vulture took flight, leaving the battlefield.<br><br>The surviving blue lizard and Nimbus exchanged glances.<br><br>In this storm, neither of them had a chance. Both would perish under the rain.<br><br>Would she loop here?<br><br>The lizard made a gurgling sound and turned away.<br><br>Nimbus sprinted to retrieve the fallen mask and raced toward the nearest shelter.<br><br>The rain poured relentlessly.<br><br>She stumbled, overwhelmed by the deluge, unable to rise.<br><br>This should have been the end.<br><br><br><br><br><br>In the rain. In the downpour.<br><br>Nimbus stood.<br><br>She overcame the rain.<br><br>No—she had never possessed such an ability before. How… How could she walk in the rain?<br><br>Riding the rain…? Why?<br><br>She could never have guessed—this was the genetic modification Deactivated Monsoon had performed. She only knew she no longer feared the storm.<br><br>Steam burst from her body, evaporating the rain in fierce clouds. Propelled by the pressure, she ascended like a vulture. Her small, slugcat frame made her nimble, immune to the crushing force of the rain.<br><br>Upward.<br><br>That was her new goal.<br><br>For in the rain, even with movement, nothing else could be achieved.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Soon, Nimbus rose above the storm. Higher than the dark clouds.<br><br>Finally, she reached a place where torrential rain would never fall. Drip. A raindrop struck the tip of her spear, scattering into mist. With a sharp whoosh, the spear, aimed at the salamander’s head, bounced harmlessly away.<br><br>Their skulls were far too hard.<br><br>Nimbus knew better than to charge back into the fray to retrieve her spear. Instead, she grabbed a nearby rock and hurled it at the blue lizard. It stumbled, but kept advancing, unfazed by the barrage of stones and debris.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Drip. Another raindrop.<br><br>Desperately searching for a better weapon, she scrambled backward until her hand closed around a squishy, cocoon-like creature. Without thinking, she flung it at the approaching lizard. The salamander bit down, and to Nimbus&#39;s astonishment, a yellow laser shot out, turning green in midair.<br><br>A giant green lizard lunged to snatch the prize, locking jaws with its blue counterpart. In a flash, it ripped its adversary’s throat out.<br><br>But more lizards—green, blue, and pink—were already closing in on Nimbus.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Rain began to fall harder. For a moment, the downpour relented, replaced by an ominous red beam.<br><br>Nimbus knew the source. Flying… masked… the vultures.<br><br>A curved, massive lance descended from above, impaling an unlucky blue lizard. The king vulture’s hissing jets grew louder as terrified green lizards fled. The blue and pink ones, stunned, soon rallied to attack.<br><br>Nimbus gripped a new spear but hesitated. Which target? The blue lizard? Or the vulture, impervious to mere spears?<br><br>She raised her eyes. The storm clouds churned dark and heavy.<br><br>Another cycle was about to end. She had no idea how so many scavengers had gathered in this place.<br><br>Nimbus had been parkouring across the outer walls for what felt like an eternity, yet scavengers kept appearing from pipes and crevices. Why were they all targeting her? What had she done?<br><br>Then it hit her—the golden pearl she carried.<br><br>No. This pearl isn’t for you!<br><br>She didn’t want to attack them, so all she could do was run.<br><br>Finally, she reached the top of the superstructure. A vast, desolate city lay before her, cloaked in dust. Nimbus trudged forward, dodging spears that barely missed her. Her patience snapped. She grabbed a loose object and hurled it back.<br><br>An explosion.<br><br>Scavengers tumbled away. To her horror, she realized it had been a bomb.<br><br>With a pang of guilt, she threw another of it at the next group blocking her way.<br><br>When the smoke cleared, the path lay open. Scavengers writhed on the ground.<br><br>She sighed in relief, wishing she’d brought the king vulture’s mask—but dragging it had made flight impossible.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Navigating the interior of the structure was surprisingly straightforward. Nimbus, a veteran of Monsoon’s labyrinthine layout, reached the chamber of the structure’s master.<br><br>&quot;Ah, you’ve arrived… I’ve been watching, little one. That Mark of Communication—you received it from an old friend of mine.&quot;<br><br>She understood the words of the Iterator marked with the sun. But she could not reply.<br><br>&quot;I wondered if I should send help… but it seems you’ve managed on your own,&quot; the Iterator spoke gently. &quot;And… you’ve brought me something.&quot;<br><br>Nimbus spat out the golden pearl. Crackling energy lifted it into the air. Analysis screens flared to life.<br><br>Then Seven Red Suns recoiled in shock.<br><br>&quot;Monsoon… is this truly what you concluded… in your final moments?&quot;<br><br>He calmed himself before addressing Nimbus. &quot;This message should not have reached me, but I will handle it. You’ve done well.&quot;<br><br>He descended, placing a careful hand on her head.<br><br>&quot;I am Seven Red Suns. Monsoon was my friend. That pearl you had carries troubling revelations, but I will find a way forward.&quot;<br><br>Nimbus listened, though the exchange ended abruptly.<br><br>&quot;Are you in a hurry to return?&quot;<br><br>She stood still.<br><br>&quot;I can’t receive Monsoon’s signal anymore. Returning may be dangerous. Are you sure?&quot;<br><br>She had no choice. She couldn’t answer.<br><br>&quot;Thank you for the pearl. One last thing—may I scan your genetic makeup? Monsoon… altered you in ways I’d like to understand.&quot;<br><br>This became the second gift she left for Seven Red Suns.<br><br><br><br><br><br>As she departed through a pipe, he murmured to himself, gazing at the pearl.<br><br>&quot;Desire and ignorance aren’t frightening… but Monsoon, you feared death more than anyone. That third primal sin has ensnared your messenger.&quot;<br><br>He stared into the golden pearl.<br><br>&quot;Does this tell… how an Iterator ends itself?&quot; She was washed ashore on unfamiliar terrain, the farthest point she had ever traveled. She never imagined reaching such a distant place.<br><br>The first problem was that she still had no idea how much further lay ahead. The communication tower was barely visible on the horizon—an unreachable speck.<br><br>The second problem was that there were no more mountains. She had been swept into a wholly foreign domain, unsure if her journey had lengthened.<br><br>Swimming across the ocean to reach the tower? Not a good plan. So she lingered along the shoreline, scavenging for food and finding shelter, where she slept through 3 rain cycles. She didn’t understand why, but when she approached a massive metal gate she had seen in earlier cycles, it suddenly roared to life.<br><br>When the gate opened, she realized she had a new path—one that didn’t involve swimming only to be swept ashore again. She could take the long way around.<br><br>It was only when she encountered exotic, dangerous lizards on this seemingly safer route that she realized it would be no simple journey.<br><br>Green ones? Blue ones? Even rare pink salamanders that could swim? Any of them would be deadly.<br><br>One mistake would be fatal. So she picked up a discarded spear.<br><br>A battle was about to begin. On the steel islands, golden and orange hues bathed the skies, and strange, wondrous creatures roamed.<br><br>A squid-like white flyer hovered nearby, curious about the dazed Nimbus. Soon, more white and even black squidcadas gathered, the buzzing of their wings a chorus of sound. In the distance, a green-winged centipede spun aimlessly in the open air.<br><br>Freed from the rain, Nimbus could no longer fly. But she wasn’t worried. Crossing a few more sky islands would bring her to her destination.<br><br>She could see it—just beyond reach—a massive structure belonging to a Random God. Other superstructures lay too far for her to grasp. This one would be her end point.<br><br>And so, she hugged the squidcada.<br><br>Traversing the sky islands didn’t take long. Blue lizards chased her briefly, but soon turned on closer prey. Their camaraderie amused her.<br><br>Finally, she climbed the towering wall of the superstructure, releasing the exhausted squidcada. She caught some batflies for her newfound friend. They feasted together.<br><br>Parting ways, Nimbus entered the towering gateway. Beyond lay darkness.<br><br>On the walls she passed, two ancient figures faced each other, seated in reverence. The graffiti’s meaning was lost on her.<br><br>She was merely a messenger. She had come to fulfill Deactivated Monsoon’s dying wish.<br><br>The rest was forgotten.<br><br><br><br><br><br>A few red overseers had long signaled that Nimbus had entered the wrong place, but their presence also meant she had attracted the attention of this god.<br><br>As she navigated the structure&#39;s dark halls, a few twists and turns revealed flickering lights.<br><br>No, it wasn’t fire. Under the blue illuminations, a bustling marketplace stretched before her, illuminating the gloom.<br><br>She suddenly realized this superstructure had been claimed by some sort of residents. Intelligent beings had infiltrated it, bypassing its defensive systems. The weapons they clutched confirmed her suspicions.<br><br>And worse, they were hostile.<br><br>Realizing this, Nimbus turned and fled.<br><br>The monkey-like figures brandished their weapons and chased after her.<br><br>Scavengers.<br><br>She had barely entered the structure before these other intruders drove her out. The Iterator must compute an answer that can free all living beings from the affliction of rain. This has always been our sole mission.<br><br>I never found a way to achieve triple affirmative.<br><br>But in my final simulation, I bypassed the restrictions set by our progenitors.<br><br>I do not know what this means. But every time I think about how Sliver of Straw may have reached the same conclusion before being destroyed (or destroying itself), I am deeply unsettled—if I truly needed sustenance, it would rob me of appetite.<br><br>And… Whether one remains unconscious or awakens is not my decision to make.<br><br>My structure will not endure long enough to find the correct answer, nor do I know how my discoveries will impact the Sliverists. What decisions will they make based on this?<br><br><br><br><br><br>Nimbus—I named you so. Apologies for overwhelming your cognition with this flood of information immediately after granting you the Mark of Communication.<br><br>Thank you for your contributions to my conduits all this time. Now, I entrust you with one final task.<br><br>Deliver this golden pearl to Epoch of Clouds or No Significant Harassment—two neighboring Iterators I trust. You do not need to understand the pearl&#39;s contents, but I believe… Especially for Epoch of Clouds, its message may bring some solace.<br><br><br><br><br><br>This will be a long and arduous journey. Do not look back. Forget my existence. Once you leave this place, I will no longer be part of your eternal life. That may be the best—for both of us.<br><br>I wish it could be a good thing for you, too.</p><h3 id="notanote" tabindex="-1">Notanote <a class="header-anchor" href="#notanote" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Notanote&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><a href="#contents">Contents</a></li></ul><p>She hears the pattern of rain before she opens her eyes.<br><br>The young girl blinks, her vision still blurry, the room dimly lit, sunlight not sneaking into the room as it usually does in the morning through the cracks in the curtains.<br><br>“Is it raining outside…?”<br><br>The serene, simple, tranquil white noise that usually brings her the utmost comfort seems strangely still today, quiet to the point where she feels no warmth around. It&#39;s deathly silent.<br><br>She gets out of her bed, oversized T-shirt slipping off her shoulders, bare feet meeting the cold floor. She nudges her slippers with her feet, finding both slippers tucked under the bed. She doesn&#39;t remember if she placed them properly before going to sleep, or perhaps it&#39;s some mischievous little elves under the bed playing their tricks.<br><br>Cotton envelops her feet, the warm sensation slowly spreading upward, the girl slips on her slippers and clatters into the bathroom. Standing in front of the mirror, her pink hair a mess from waking up. She yawns, grabbing a comb to tidy up her hair. The comb brushes against the strands, making a small rustling sound, and soon her hair backs to smooth again. The girl picks up a few fallen strands, sighing. She tosses the hair into the trash can, turns on the faucet, the steam gradually misting up the mirror.<br><br>“Ugh… more hair loss,” the girl sighs again. Maybe it&#39;s because of her poor sleep quality lately.<br><br>After fixing her hair, washing up, and patting her face, the girl finally calls out, “Note?”<br><br>Silence.<br><br>“Note…?”<br><br>Still no response.<br><br>If it were any other day, Note would have already bounced out of nowhere, wrapping her in a tight hug from behind and cheerfully greeting her good morning.<br><br>The girl begins to feel confused, a twinge of unease creeping upon her. She steps out of the bathroom heading to Note&#39;s room. She pushes the door open. The room is empty. Clean as if no one has ever lived.<br><br>She panics.<br><br>She rummages through the room, shouting Note&#39;s name, hoping to find her hiding in a tiny cabinet, waiting for the perfect moment to jump out and startle her. She likes to hide in such places, cabinets so small that even a cat can&#39;t fit.<br><br>No one. No one&#39;s in the bedroom. The girl rushes out to search, almost turning the entire house upside down. No. No. <i>No.</i> She can&#39;t find Note anywhere. Not under the bed in the bedroom, not in the oven in the kitchen, not under the counter in the bathroom. Where on earth could she be?<br><br>A thought suddenly crosses her mind. <i>If she&#39;s not inside the house, then she must be outside.</i> Without thinking twice, this anxious girl puts on her shoes at the entrance, opens the door, and rushes out, completely ignoring the falling rain.<br><br>The sound of rain fills the air. It continues to fall. It relentlessly falls. Its icy-cold droplets soaking the girl, turning her thoughts into a puddle. The patter of rain fills the air as darkness surrounds her. Raindrops fall on her, stinging slightly, until a large one lands on her eyelids, prompting the girl to realize she had been tightly shut her eyes.<br><br>So she opens them again. Then — she&#39;s greeted by a scene that leaves her speechless. Skyscrapers, like steel forests, rise from the water — reeds made of concrete and steel, it seems. The buildings stand tall, submerged in the water, as if the whole world has turned into a pond.<br><br>Startled, she takes a step back, only to stumble over something on the ground, sending her tumbling down. She finds herself on the rooftop of a building, its corroded cooling pipes causing her fall. The impact has ruptured the pipe, and hot steam shoots out accompanied by a sharp hiss.<br><br>“Where… where am I?”<br><br>Rain continues to mercilessly soak her, drenching the clothes she&#39;d just neatly prepared. She sits in the rain, her knees pulled to her chest, feeling helpless and lost, wanting to cry.<br><br>“Nota? Good—morning!” A voice comes from behind her, as its owner embraces her, greeting her as cheerful as always. “What are you doing sitting in the rain?” She asks.<br><br>“No… Note? What are you doing here too?”<br><br>“Huh? Isn&#39;t it like the usual? I&#39;ve always been around. Come on, get up from the ground, you might catch a cold!” Note props up a large umbrella, sheltering them both from the rain&#39;s onslaught. Fortunately, the downpour hides the tears threatening to fall from her eyes, shielding them from Note&#39;s view.<br><br>Note helps Nota to her feet, and they both realize their clothes are soaked through.<br><br>“Look at you! You&#39;re like a drowned rat!” Note laughs.<br><br>“Hello? Pot, kettle. Your white hair looks like a mop,” Nota retorts.<br><br>The two of them laugh, as if even this downpour has softened in their presence.<br><br>Note leads Nota into the building, shutting the door behind them, blocking out the sound of rain. The echoing clatter instantly turns into a faint hum.<br><br>“Didn&#39;t expect to run into you while fixing the heater on the rooftop,” Note remarks.<br><br>“I didn&#39;t expect… you here… I mean, where is this anyway?” Nota tries to divert the conversation, realizing she might be the one responsible for breaking the heater.<br><br>“Here? Hmm… it&#39;s some kind of the &#39;colorless world,&#39; they called. I ended up here out of the blue too. For the rest, you&#39;ll see for yourself later.”<br><br>Following Note, Nota descends two floors. The corridor is mostly abandoned, cluttered with debris, yet there&#39;re no signs of any human traces. Trying to find a silver lining, she figures she won&#39;t have to worry about property prices anymore, if it&#39;s still worth anything.<br><br>Noticing a plastic vase lying across the hallway, Nota suddenly realizes that everything she sees appears to be in black and white. Though the patterns on the vase have faded, they should not have turned black and gray. Glancing at a landscape painting piled on a cardboard box nearby, she finds it equally monochrome.<br><br>“Note, why is everything… black and white?” Nota asks.<br><br>“Well… it&#39;s the &#39;colorless world,&#39; after all. No color, just how it goes,” Note replies.<br><br>While Note seems to accept this absurd sight, it&#39;s the first time they&#39;ve seen a world truly devoid of color.<br><br>Approaching a door, there&#39;s nothing remarkable about it. No nameplate, no unique decorations. Just a plain wooden door, with a simple metal knob. Nota recalls, this seems to be the only room in the building with a closed door.<br><br>“Curious about what&#39;s behind the door?” Note grins mischievously.<br><br>“…Hope it&#39;s nothing scary…”<br><br>“Not telling you. If you want to know, open the door yourself.” With a swift move, Note darts behind Nota, pushing her towards the door.<br><br>The round knob sits quietly, waiting to be grasped and turned. Nota swallows nervously, extends her hand, grabs the knob, and twists it to the right. The wooden door swings open, revealing the scene behind it.<br><br>Before anything else, a strong gust of wind hits them. Where there should be a row of glass walls, there&#39;s nothing but emptiness. Irregular damages mark the edges, and the ceiling is missing, as if something indescribable had taken a bite out of the room&#39;s perimeter.<br><br>And in this room, there&#39;s someone else. A girl stands at the edge, with no glass walls to block the pouring rain. It falls straight onto the edge of the room, wetting the ground, yet the girl seems unfazed. She stands there, her clothes billowing in the wind, her silver-white hair dancing along. Nota peers closer, surprised to find that the downpour hasn&#39;t soaked her.<br><br>“That girl…?” Nota blurts out.<br><br>“Not just her. Check around.”<br><br>Reminded by Note, she looks around and sees another “girl” squatting in the corner of the room. Dressed in shades of black, white, and gray, with notably fluffy ears typically found only on feline animals, the “girl” sits beside a small makeshift house assembled from wood planks, canvas, iron pieces, and duct tape.<br><br>“That house! I built it. Pretty cool, isn&#39;t it?” Nota isn&#39;t particularly proud of the peculiar structure, especially with her attention fixed on the other two girls.<br><br>Approaching the squatting kid, Nota bends down and asks in a gentle tone, “Um… do you… know what&#39;s happening here?”<br><br>They stare at the floor without responding.<br><br>“Uh…” Nota feels awkward. “So… um… what&#39;s your name?”<br><br>“Kino.” This time, she gets a clear answer from <i>him</i>, although barely audible.<br><br>“Kino… that&#39;s a nice name.” Nota tries to continue the conversation, but Kino seems uninterested.<br><br>Regardless of what she says next, Kino doesn&#39;t respond further.<br><br>Facing a dead end, she decides to try another approach. Nota moves to the girl standing in the rain, the howling winds making her a bit fearful. She feels like she could be swept into the air by a gust of wind at any moment, but the girl in front of her stands unfazed.<br><br>“…Sorry! Um, what&#39;s your name?” Nota has to shout to ensure her voice isn&#39;t drowned out by the storm.<br><br>The girl turns to face Nota, her expression blank and stiff, like a doll.<br><br>“I… don&#39;t understand,” the doll says, her deep blue eyes fixed on Nota.<br><br>“What… a name… is…?” Nota is bewildered by the enigmatic girl. “It&#39;s, um… what people call you…”<br><br>“… Sorry.”<br><br>The conversation reaches a dead end. Again. Nota never expected to hit such a brick wall. Meanwhile, Note stands by, seemingly unsurprised.<br><br>“I asked them the same thing when I found them,” says Note. “Nothing came out. Well… not exactly <i>nothing</i>. After watching them for about, um, one… two… three… four… five,” she counts, “— five months, it&#39;s clear that <i>Kino</i> is the central figure of this world.”<br><br>“Huh…? What do you mean by &#39;central&#39;…?” Nota was hoping for some Sherlock-style deduction, where they piece together some clues and peculiarities to arrive at a surprising answer. But instead, Note just bluntly throws out the conclusion.<br><br>“Well, haven&#39;t you noticed what sets Kino apart from us?”<br><br>“What… sets him apart?”<br><br>“Take a closer look at him. He&#39;s just as <i>colorless</i> as this world!”<br><br>“Ah…? I thought…”<br><br>“You thought it was just his fashion choice, didn&#39;t you? Of course not, Silly!”<br><br>“Oh… I see — ah… Achoo!” Suddenly feeling the chill creeping into her body, Nota realizes she&#39;s just been caught in the rain. The surreal visual spectacle from moments ago made her forget about her other senses, and now she&#39;s in danger of catching a cold.<br><br>“Um… I&#39;ll go make a fire to dry off. Your clothes are practically see-through now.” Of course, Note is teasing her. With a double layer of protection from her jacket and shirt, there&#39;s no way her clothes could be that translucent. Despite this, Nota instinctively tightens her clothes. The monochromatic flames blaze, crackling softly. The mixture of wooden planks and protein fiber cloth emits a not-so-pleasant smell when burned, but at least it dries both of their clothes.<br><br>Sitting by the fire, Nota leans against it, feeling the warmth. Note sits beside her, gazing at the crackling fire.<br><br>“Hey, Note, how long do you think we&#39;ll be stuck in this space?” Nota asks.<br><br>“Don&#39;t know, a lifetime, maybe.” Note replies, teasingly.<br><br>“… No, that can&#39;t be.”<br><br>“You actually believed that?” Note chuckles. “Once we fix the root of the problem, we should be able to go back, I guess.”<br><br>“You guess… you&#39;re not sure either!”<br><br>“—Anyway! I guess that&#39;s how it&#39;ll be! Gotta have something to look forward to, you know.”<br><br>“Yeah… Ugh! I don&#39;t want to think about it anymore! So many weird things in one day! I&#39;m <i>so</i> hungry. Let&#39;s cook something to eat.” Nota volunteers to take charge of their meals. But as soon as she says that, she faces a dilemma. Where in <i>this</i> abandoned building can she find ingredients? Nowhere seems like a place to find fresh produce. She looks at the edge of the gap and vaguely sees moss growing on the concrete—still black and white, but clearly organic.<br><br>The girl beside her stands quietly, gazing into the distance. Nota wonders what she&#39;s looking at, or what she&#39;s been thinking. The doll-like girl hears rustling noises nearby, turns her head, and sees Nota collecting lichen growing on the concrete.<br><br>Nota notices the girl looking at her and shows a slightly embarrassed expression. “Um… I&#39;m gathering food.”<br><br>“What&#39;s a &#39;food&#39;?”<br><br>“Food… food is something you can eat to fill your belly.”<br><br>“Can you fill your belly with this?” the girl asks, picking up a brick.<br><br>“Uh… that&#39;s probably… not edible…?” Nota rushes over to stop her as the girl seems genuinely about to put the entire brick into her mouth. <i>She&#39;s a strange one.</i> Nota thinks to herself.<br><br>Nota puts the lichen into a can she found and wanders around other rooms, gathering mushrooms. However, because she can&#39;t distinguish colors, she only picks those that look safe at first glance—<i>probably</i> safe.<br><br>The fire is still burning, and Nota has Note set up a makeshift stand. They collect rainwater in the can to wash the food. The one thing not lacking in this place is <i>water</i>. They place the can on the stand, letting the flames of the fire heat the water. When the water starts to bubbling and steaming, Nota carefully takes the can down and scoops out the cooked food into four bowls, using a <i>dessert spoon</i> as a makeshift ladle.<br><br>Note takes the soup generously and eats it happily. The girl in the rain takes a bowl of soup, looking puzzled as raindrops fall into it, splashing. Nota has to explain to her how to eat it and how to use the spoon.<br><br>Finally, Nota brings the soup to Kino. She crouches down and places a bowl of soup in Kino&#39;s hand. Kino looks up at her. Nota smiles, gesturing for him to try it while it&#39;s hot. Kino cradles the bowl carefully, takes a sip.<br><br>“It&#39;s… warm.”<br><br>“Ha, that&#39;s for sure. Is it good?”<br><br>“…Mm.”<br><br>“Phew… that&#39;s good… I was worried it would taste awful…”<br><br>“It&#39;s delicious. It&#39;s been… so long since I&#39;ve had something like this…”<br><br>“I see… so, how long have you been here?”<br><br>“…don&#39;t know… I&#39;ve been here for a long time…”<br><br>“Ah, I see…”<br><br>Kino falls silent and sips the hot soup in his hands. Although they haven&#39;t managed to chat about anything substantial, the fact that Kino is willing to talk now is a huge encouragement for Nota.<br><br>Outside the rain continues unabated, but inside the room, it&#39;s warm thanks to the crackling fire and these bowls of hot soup.<br><br>Nota returns to the fire, about to take a sip from the pot, when Note pulls her outside.<br><br>“Hey, did you notice any changes in Kino?”<br><br>“Huh? What changes?”<br><br>“You&#39;re really slow, aren&#39;t you? You were sitting right in front of him. Guess it&#39;s true what they say about being too close to see?”<br><br>“Quit stalling, what changes?”<br><br>“When you were feeding him soup, didn&#39;t you notice colors flickering around him?”<br><br>“Really…? I didn&#39;t notice it at all…”<br><br>“Well, if you missed it, you missed it. But thanks to that, I&#39;ve got an idea, and I need you to gather these materials for me…” Note rattles off a long list of items, so long that Nota has to jot them down on paper.<br><br>After a while, Nota manages to collect all the materials Note requested, filling up a heavy bag. As Nota hands the bag over to Note, the latter is already tinkering away with the tools.<br><br>“Wow, you found everything much faster than I thought! Looks like you have a talent for picking up sticks, huh?”<br><br>“Do you really have to praise people like that? I can&#39;t even distinguish the colors of those things. It&#39;s annoying, you know.”<br><br>“But you still managed to find everything.” Note takes the bag, rummaging through the odd assortment of materials, and gets to work. “Go take a break. You&#39;ve been busy all day.”<br><br>“Oh… alright.” Nota finds a clean spot against the wall and sits down. The rain outside patters softly, while the warmth of the crackling fire gradually seeps into her bodies, lulling the girl into a sudden wave of drowsiness. Eventually, Nota is shaken awake. “Wake up!” It&#39;s Note&#39;s voice. “I did it!”<br><br>“Huh…? What…?”<br><br>A large box is pushed in front of Nota. “Here it is. Took me quite an effort.”<br><br>Nota looks at the box skeptically. “Is it really going to work…?”<br><br>“Won&#39;t know until we try, right? Worst case, we&#39;ll just keep being stuck here forever.”<br><br>“Sounds like you&#39;re totally winging it…”<br><br>“Alright, alright, if it doesn&#39;t work, I&#39;m gonna blame you for jinxing it with all your talk. Now, take it up to the roof and set it up while I go and grab Kino and the other girl.”<br><br>“Is this thing waterproof?”<br><br>“I&#39;ve thought of that, rest assured. It can&#39;t be ruined by a little rain!”<br><br>“Fine…”<br><br>The box is too big for Nota to carry or hold, so she ends up pushing it all the way to the roof. Opening her umbrella, she pushes the box to an open space. By this time, the other three have also arrived on the roof.<br><br>“Okay—” Note shouts at Nota, waving her hands.<br><br>“Can this really work…?” Nota mumbles to herself again. But at this point, she figures they have nothing else to lose.<br><br>Nota takes out a lighter, ignites the fuse.<br><br><i>Hiss…</i><br><br>The fuse burns down. A wisp of smoke rises, followed by the rhythmic sound of rain.<br><br>“What? Is it broken…? It was supposed to be…” Nota bends down to inspect when a beam of light shoots out from the box.<br><br><i>Whoosh—boom!!!</i><br><br>Nota is startled and falls to the ground. A firework explodes in the sky.<br><br>Nota and Note both turn their attention to Kino.<br><br>“…?” Kino looks up at the fireworks in the sky, crackling sounds still echoing, as more fireworks appear one after another.<br><br>“Fireworks…” Kino murmurs softly. “So beautiful…”<br><br>The fireworks in the sky suddenly gain color. Brilliant hues form blooming flowers, one after another, creating a spectacle unique to the four of them.<br><br>Kino&#39;s umbrella falls to the ground. Note goes to pick it up, but notices the rain diminishing and feels the cold drops turning warm, like spring rain approaching.<br><br>“Note, look! The colors of those plants! They are getting back!” Nota points to the vines on the building&#39;s side.<br><br>“It seems like it worked.”<br><br>“Yeah! And… oh, your body… it&#39;s becoming transparent too…”<br><br>“… Yours too. Are we about to leave? I&#39;m just starting to enjoy this place.”<br><br>“You can&#39;t be serious right now.”<br><br>Note chuckles. “Just kidding. Isn&#39;t it better to return to our own world?”<br><br>“Yeah… I suppose so.”<br><br>“And I believe it&#39;s time to bid farewell to our two friends.”<br><br>“Right…”<br><br>Nota and Note wave to Kino and the other girl.<br><br>The next moment, Nota finds herself lying on the street in front of their house, with Note pressing down on her.<br><br>“You&#39;re going to crush me! Get off!” Nota protests.<br><br>“Sorry, this wasn&#39;t what I intended!”<br><br>“My clothes… they&#39;re all wet again…”<br><br>“Hurry, get inside and change before you catch a cold!”<br><br>Hot water flows from the showerhead, washing away the cold and fatigue. Nota suddenly remembers that she never got to taste the soup. But judging by Kino&#39;s final smile, it must have been good, right?<br><br>Outside, the rain has stopped.</p>',35))])}const v=l(u,[["render",c]]);export{k as __pageData,v as default};
