They place her in isolation, hooking her up to life-support equipment, and then they sigh，leaving the room.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The equipment drips rhythmically, as if she&#39;s just fallen into a peaceful sleep.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The rain outside continues to fall.

They&#39;re afraid this illness might spread.<br><br><br><br><br><br>At night, people gather around the campfire and whisper about Susan. Some say she should be sent to the surface, some say she should stay here, and some even suggest turning off the life support. But they argue and, in the end, nothing is decided. People secretly hope the equipment will stop on its own, so they won&#39;t have to take any responsibility.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Tonight, I still have dreamless sleep.

The rain outside amplified my anxiety, every drop hitting the ground like an echo of my dread.<br><br>“Don&#39;t worry too much. We&#39;ll figure something out.”<br><br>That’s what he said. But we both knew that we had no way out.<br><br>Soon, the news spread. There was no hiding a swelling belly, after all.<br><br>Everyone was happy. They celebrated, rejoicing over the arrival of new life.<br><br>Day by day, my stomach grew. The reality of becoming a mother settled in, yet I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t ready. I didn’t know how to be a mother. This child had arrived so suddenly, without warning, without asking, and I had no say in the matter.<br><br>When my pregnancy reached the eighth month, the weight of my unborn child made even daily movements difficult. Robert took on all my work. He did everything — washing my feet, wiping my back — while I lay in bed, watching him rush around. “You don’t need to do anything,” he told me. “Just rest. That’s all that matters now.”<br><br>I could feel the baby kicking inside me. Sometimes, a tiny bulge would appear on my stomach. In those moments, I knew that my child was greeting me. Maybe it was the warmth of maternal instinct, suddenly, the fear of the future faded. All that was left was anticipation.<br><br>Giving birth hurt more than I ever imagined. The older women tending to me kept saying, “Just hold on, it’ll pass.” But it didn’t feel like something that could just <i>pass</i>. It felt like my body was being ripped apart. Pain so intense, it blurred the line between agony and numbness. Sweat soaked my clothes. Blood stained the sheets. My screams echoed through the entire floor. <br><br>And then, suddenly — the pain stopped. In its place came a sharp cry.<br><br>The old women congratulated me. “It’s a boy,” they said.<br><br>Tears blurred my vision as I laughed. I held him in my arms. Luciel looked up at me, wide-eyed with wonder. I gazed back at him. He giggled.<br><br>And in that moment, every pain I had suffered felt meaningless. I finally understood what the old women meant. <i>“Just hold on, it’ll pass.”</i> Seeing a tiny life smile at you — it really does wash away everything. <br><br><br><br><br><br>But my body didn’t recover.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The toll of childbirth left me weak, too weak to even nurse Luciel properly. The nausea wouldn’t stop, and the cold sweats almost drained me. I couldn’t even hold my child without trembling. Others had to take him away, to another room, where someone else could care for him. Robert was worried — more than worried.<br><br>And me?<br><br>I was left alone, trapped with my own thoughts—dark, desperate thoughts. The weakness overtook me, and with it came regret. I regretted bringing him into this world, this place where suffering was all he would know. I couldn’t care for him. I was weak and sickly. What if I died? Would he suffer because of me?<br><br>I clutched Robert’s hand, as tightly as I could, my voice barely above a whisper. I made him to promise me. I told him that no matter what it took, he had to give our child a good life. I didn’t want him to grow up here.<br><br>Robert held my cold, trembling fingers, nodded, and said he will.<br><br>He found a way. A way to take Luciel somewhere better. A way to give him a future that didn’t begin and end in this decaying tower. But the cost was steep: he had to leave. He would work for others, far from here, and Luciel would be taken away to a safer place, one where he could be raised without fear. “Everything we do is for him,” Robert told me.<br><br>I thought of Luciel’s smile, then looked at Robert. My baby shared his father’s eyes. I nodded.<br><br>And then both of them were gone. I was left alone.<br><br>A week passed, and my body slowly began to recover. I was still weak, but at least I could stand, could walk again.<br><br>I went to Luciel’s crib, knowing what I would find. Empty. He was gone. The only thing left was a small plastic bird, swaying slightly, as if it, too, understood the absence. My baby was gone. So was Robert. I looked around. The others averted their gazes, avoiding my eyes as if I carried some kind of misfortune.<br><br>I went to the old women to thank them. I wanted to do something for them. They only smiled. “It’s fine. Just rest.”<br><br>I went to Robert’s coworkers, hoping to help with their work. They dismissed me.<br><br>“It’s not your problem.”<br><br>“You need to recover.”<br><br>“Go rest.”<br><br><br><br><br><br>Was I… unnecessary?<br><br><br><br><br><br>I sat in the corner of the room, unable to stop the tears. After everything, I had lost everything. I was left with nothing. I kept telling myself Luciel had a better future now, that this was the right choice. But the hollow space inside me only grew wider. No matter how much I tried to reason with myself, nothing changed the truth: that I would <i>never</i> see my child again. I didn’t know when Robert would return, or if he ever would. I didn’t know when, or if, I would ever see Luciel’s smile again.<br><br>The rain outside was loud. I remembered hearing once: “step into the rain, and you’ll never wake up again.” And I wondered, if I never woke up… would I finally be free from this pain?<br><br>The rain outside was loud. The older women came to comfort me, saying everything would be okay. Just hold on. Just a little longer. For the child.<br><br>The rain outside was loud. And I should hold on, for the child. For the child, Robert had left me. For the child, I had become an outsider. For the <i>child</i>…<br><br>And then, for the first time, a thought crept into my mind. A thought so terrible, it scared even me. If I had never had a child, none of this would have happened. Robert and I would still be here, struggling, but together. He would still be by my side, whispering promises we both knew would never come true but still wanted to believe in.<br><br>If only there had been no child… <i>No</i>. I shouldn’t think this way. But the thought kept returning, again and again, relentless, whispering until I began to believe it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The rain outside was loud.<br><br><br><br><br><br>On many nights, I wept, silently, making sure no one could hear. The rain was the only thing that still hid me. If not for the rain, I might have lost even that last bit of shelter.<br><br>I was so afraid. Afraid of myself. Afraid of my own thoughts. I didn’t know what I was becoming. I felt like I was falling apart, coming undone.<br><br>The rain outside kept falling.<br><br>And so, I made a decision. A selfish decision.<br><br>The rain on the rooftop was deafening.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I went up.<br><br>All around me…<br><br>Only the sound of rain.</p><hr><h2 id="side-story" tabindex="-1">Side Story <a id="side"></a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#side-story" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Side Story &lt;a id=&quot;side&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="a-spring-waiting-in-blossoms" tabindex="-1">A Spring Waiting in Blossoms <a id="side1"></a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-spring-waiting-in-blossoms" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A Spring Waiting in Blossoms &lt;a id=&quot;side1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="_1-1-1" tabindex="-1">1.1 <a id="side1-1"></a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-1-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1.1  &lt;a id=&quot;side1-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The mountains once offered the divine ones a girl of peerless beauty.<br><br>Yet as the steadfast stone is unseen by shallow hearts,<br><br>too shall the eternal rain lay low all mortal blossoms.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It hasn&#39;t rained here... in a very, very long time.<br><br>No one can quite remember when it started—the skies stayed clear ever since a random day. The scorching sun baked the land and dried the rivers, leading to crops withering. The village well was almost at its end.<br><br>The village adults had returned from their resource search. One glance at their faces was enough to find out that this was an empty-handed attempt. Again.<br><br>Papa and Mama were among them. Their skin had darkened further under the relentless sunlight.<br><br>I dropped the embroidered ball in my hands and ran over to them on quick, light steps.<br><br>“Papa, Mama! I stayed home just like you told me! I didn’t run around, and I didn’t waste a single drop! Praise me!” I smiled and squinted my eyes, tiptoeing as I leaned my head toward them. This short run left me breathless.<br><br>&quot;Such a good girl, Honoka! Just like you&#39;d expect from the pride of the Asagi family!&quot; Papa laughed and patted my head, and I giggled happily in return.<br><br>“Hmph! Of course! I’m the one keeping this whole household together!” I boasted.<br><br>Mama gently cupped my cheek with her rough hands—her touch always made me feel safe. “They didn’t bully you while we were away, did they? You feeling okay?” she asked.<br><br>“Of course not!” I kept on smiling. I couldn’t possibly tell Papa and Mama that the other kids had come by again, mocking me, calling me sickly, claiming I was cursed. That would just make them sad... or worse, angry.<br><br>“Happy to hear that... Don’t pay attention to anything they say. They’re just jealous of you,” Mama said gently.<br><br>“Jealous? Jealous of what?” I asked, confused.<br><br>“They’re jealous of how thoughtful you are. And how much your parents care about you,” Papa added.<br><br>“No wonder! So that’s why they look down on us—they’re just jealous!”<br><br>“Not so loud!” Mama quickly pressed her hand over my mouth. “Let’s talk inside. It’s too hot to be standing out here.”<br><br><br><br><br><br>Bitter, sour medicine was simmering on the stove. Honestly, I didn’t think any of it could truly cure me.<br><br>This illness—this frailty that had haunted me since birth, like a curse—probably couldn’t be healed, no matter what we tried.<br><br>“Here, drink your medicine.” Mama ladled some into a bowl and brought it over to me.<br><br>Steam curled up from the bowl, carrying that awful smell. “Do I really have to drink this...? Papa and Mama could’ve saved the water for something more important...”<br><br>“Nothing more important than helping you get better,” Mama said.<br><br>“Okay... thank you, Mama...” I knew how much they had to sacrifice. They gave up half of their own daily water just to make this one bowl.<br><br>“It’s alright. If it helps you get better, we’ll do anything,” she said, gently stroking my head. Her eyes shimmered with love and pain.<br><br>What I hated most... was seeing them give up too much for me. If I didn’t exist in the first place, maybe their lives would’ve been much easier. They wouldn’t have become the targets of ridicule, raising a sickly daughter like me.<br><br>This bowl of medicine tasted like our lives. Bitter, but we had no choice but to swallow it down.<br><br>Watching me drink it, Mama’s tense brow finally eased. “Here, have a sakura-mochi (cherry blossom rice cake). If you eat it, the bitterness will fly away.” She pulled a small rice cake wrapped in cloth from her pocket.<br><br>“Thanks, Mama!” I grabbed the mochi and munched happily. It was sweet, with a soft floral fragrance. I wondered if that was the true taste of cherry blossoms, but it felt pink... so that must be it.<br><br>I wiped a crumb from the corner of my mouth. “When it rains... when the plants come back... will everything be good again?”<br><br>“Yes. Once it rains, everything will get better. We won’t just have sakura mochi—we’ll have candied apples, red bean sweets, all kinds of treats.”</p><hr><h4 id="_1-2-1" tabindex="-1">1.2 <a id="side1-2"></a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-2-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1.2  &lt;a id=&quot;side1-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Such days went on. The people in the village still couldn’t locate a single water source.<br><br>The cherry blossom trees in our yard had all withered. Its pink petals lost their luster, scattered all over the ground. Our neighbors were suffering from the drought too—But they don’t have to take special care of a child like me.<br><br>“Here, drink the medicine...” Mama brought over the bowl again.<br><br>“Mama...” I looked at her—her lips had cracked from dehydration. Tiny traces of blood were seeping out.<br><br>“Just drink it, dear. I’ll be fine.”<br><br>“But...”<br><br>Papa walked over and placed his heavy hand on my head. “Don’t worry. We’ll find a way. There’s no need for our precious daughter to bear the worry. Just drink the medicine, alright?”<br><br>“Papa, your hands are too rough!” I pulled away, complained.<br><br>“How else can I show I care?” Papa grinned wide. “Come on, be good. Drink it.”<br><br>“Then if I do, can you be gentle next time?” I leaned in playfully.<br><br>“Sure. I’ll be gently rough,” Papa joked.<br><br>“You’re such a big kid—more childish than Honoka herself,” Mama said, shaking her head, smiling.<br><br>I took the medicine, raised the bowl to drink, but a sudden weakness took hold. I started coughing violently. The bowl slipped, spilling the medicine onto the floor.<br><br>“Honoka!?” Mama called out, panic trembling in her voice.<br><br>“It’s okay... I’ll be fine...” I tried to calm her. But I caught the shadow of worry in her eyes.<br><br>That was what I never wanted to see from her.<br><br>Glancing sideways, I saw Father’s cheerful expression faltering into concern.<br><br>Don’t look at me like that... your gentle eyes make me feel like nothing but a burden.<br><br>“Do not worry! I’ll get better really soon!” I said, swallowing the remaining medicine with a forced grin.<br><br>Maybe seeing my smile eased their fears. “...Yeah. You’ll get better really fast.”<br><br>But I could feel bitterness behind their soft, kind expressions, just like tasting this medicine.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Night fell, and the stifling heat gave way to a biting cold.<br><br>Moonlight spilled over the empty land, pure and pale.<br><br>Back then, I would have been sitting beneath the cherry blossoms with my parents, savoring cold watermelon from the river, sneaking sips of Papa’s sake (alcoholic beverage) behind Mama’s back. Now, the tree stood bare, stripped of every leaf.<br><br>From the room far away, voices rose in sharp tension. Never before had I heard my parents speak so harshly. It sounded almost like a quarrel.<br><br>I knew they were arguing because of me.<br><br>After a while, the voices ceased. I waited, sensing they wished to speak to me.<br><br>The door slid open. Two sets of footsteps approached. “Honoka, watching the moon?” Papa’s voice was soft. “Mama and I want to talk with you about something.”<br><br>“Huh? What is it?” I turned to them, tilting my head.<br><br>Papa knelt before me. “This is something only you can do, Honoka. If you don’t want to, we won’t force you.”<br><br>“Only I can do? What could that be?”<br><br>Papa hesitated. Mama placed a gentle hand on Papa’s shoulder, “Honoka, are you willing to become a shrine maiden, to pray for rain?”<br><br>“A shrine maiden...? To pray for rain...?”<br><br>“Don’t worry too much about it. Just think of it like pretend play— you’ll wear some beautiful clothes, say a few words, and that’s all.” Mama spoke kindly.<br><br>“That’s... all?” I asked.<br><br>“Mhm. We’ll handle the rest.”<br><br>“Will I... really be helping?” I verified.<br><br>“You’re the only one that can help, Honoka...” Mama looked at me.<br><br>“The only one...” I whispered the words to myself.<br><br>There was something irresistible about that phrase.<br><br>Finally... I could help Mama and Papa. I wasn’t a burden anymore, nor the sickly child they pitied. There’s something only I could do.<br><br>“I’ll be a shrine maiden,” I smilied at them.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The next day, my parents dressed me in the outfit they prepared—a black shrine maiden’s robe.<br><br>“I knew it’ll suit you perfectly.”<br><br>“Honoka’s grown into such a beauty.”<br><br>They shone with pride.<br><br>I stood up, spun slowly, sleeves fluttering like petals on a gentle breeze.<br><br>Mama looked at me and said, “You really do look like a shrine maiden.”<br><br>“What are you saying? I am one!” I twirled again.<br><br>“Indeed. Honoka is now our Haru-no-Miko (shrine maiden of spring),” Papa said. “Look—the cherry tree in the yard is blooming because of you.”<br><br>I immediately turned to look—the once-barren branches were covered in blossoms.<br><br>“They really bloomed!” I shouted, overjoyed. “This is all because of me?”<br><br>“Yes. Since you agreed to become Haru-no-Miko, the flowers awakened,” Papa said.<br><br>I gazed at my hands and the robe in wonder, “So... I really am a shrine maiden! My strange body... it must be implying I was meant to be one!”<br><br>“That’s correct… Because you were chosen, Honoka,” Mama said.<br><br><br><br></p><hr><h4 id="_1-3-1" tabindex="-1">1.3 <a id="side1-3"></a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-3-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1.3  &lt;a id=&quot;side1-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Perhaps it was because everyone had truly run out of hope, or maybe the sight of the cherry blossoms blooming in our yard struck a silent awe into their hearts. Either way, the villagers came to believe that I was Haru-no-Miko, the spring shrine maiden.<br><br>Papa and Mama built me a ritual platform, so I could offer prayers upon it.<br><br>Never in my dreams had I imagined that those who once looked down on us with cold eyes would now kneel obediently at my feet.<br><br>Behind me, Mama and Papa played sacred instruments.<br><br>I stood atop the platform, clumsily performing the rituals, waving the gohei (wooden wand) in my hand.<br><br>That alone was enough. The villagers would gasp with awe and reverence, offering tributes and money in humble submission.<br><br>“Great Maiden... please, beseech the god above to send us rain!!” Their voices trembled with desperation.<br><br>“The god have heard your plea… now, we must wait...” I recited the words Papa and Mama had taught me.<br><br>Those very “adults” who once thought me a useless child treated me with such solemn respect, such devout fear.<br><br>I looked down at them with pride and disdain. Their humble posture brought a quiet joy to my heart.<br><br>“There are those among you...” I said slowly,“who show no respect to the god...” These were not the words Papa and Mama had taught me, but my own.<br><br>The crowd stirred anxiously. Fear and confusion spread. “W-who dares to disrespect the god...?”<br><br>I slowly raised the gohei and pointed to the children in the crowd—those who had mocked and bullied me.<br><br>“No... no way, they’re just kids...” they were shocked.<br><br>“Precisely,” I said sharply, “because they are children, they lack reverence, and unknowingly reveal wickedness.”<br><br>The children were terrified. The adults pressed their heads to the ground, trembling, begging forgiveness from me and the god.<br><br>I could clearly hear those kids crying, scared out of their minds.<br><br>And I laughed. I laughed loud and long. The crowd below stiffened in fear.<br><br>“The gods have forgiven your thoughtless sins. Now, depart and wait in silence...”<br><br><br><br><br><br>The rain came late—but it did come.<br><br>Our family’s life changed.<br><br>Papa and Mama didn’t have to wear patched-up clothes anymore. I could eat candied apples. We no longer shared a single bucket of water to bathe three people.<br><br>But I knew—these days would not last.<br><br>I saw it. Papa and Mama secretly attached fake petals to the cherry tree. Haru-no-Miko was nothing but a lie. The “fact” that cherry blossoms bloom naturally before spring rains even arrive—those villagers believed it to be the work of the god.<br><br>The amulets bought with their offerings had no power. I had no special abilities, too. I was just a sick child.<br><br>Yet even so, I chose to keep the lie alive. Because it was the only way I could help Papa and Mama.<br><br>After finishing my usual prayers, I stepped down from the platform.<br><br>“Great Maiden... may I ask...” a villager hesitated before continuing, “Does it really require so many offerings every year to bring us rain?”<br><br>“We’re running out of things to offer...”<br><br>“So are we...”<br><br>“Great Maiden! Please, speak to the god for us!”<br><br>“Does the god really care about such meager offerings...?”<br><br>“Hey, does the god even exist...”<br><br>The villagers grew restless.<br><br>“You dare show such disrespect to the god! Do you wish to bring calamity upon yourselves?!”I imagined how a true shrine maiden would respond, and shouted loudly.<br><br>They were stunned by my voice. I looked at them angrily, “Hey! What are you staring at? Before the gods’ anger falls, step back!”<br><br>Their stares suddenly grew sharp. The dangerous emotion in their stare brought me fear.<br><br>I felt a flicker of fear but maintained my shrine maiden stance until they all left.</p><hr><h4 id="_1-4-1" tabindex="-1">1.4 <a id="side1-4"></a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-4-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1.4  &lt;a id=&quot;side1-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Since then, drought returned again and again to this land.<br><br>Not long after, I had my coming-of-age ceremony. How many years had I been the shrine maiden now? I couldn’t even remember what I used to do for fun. Or what I once dreamed of becoming.<br><br>I had already gained everything I thought I wanted.<br><br>And at the same time… I had gained everything I never asked for.<br><br>I still remembered fragments of my childhood. After Father and Mother entrusted me with the role of shrine maiden, I began to understand things a child my age should never have known. I had always just been… me. So why did their attitudes change so drastically?<br><br>One way or another, the wheel of fate had turned. What I saw—what I felt—every moment of it filled me with revulsion. Blind devotion to power. Foolishness. People who had no value as individuals. How could I possibly respect them?<br><br>No. I had never respected them.<br><br>Even before I became a true shrine maiden. They were never worthy of divine favor.<br><br>——And yet, as the voice of the gods, I could bestow their blessings upon the unworthy?<br><br>That revulsion which once polluted my senses… slowly twisted into joy.<br><br>Joy at the transformation of my role. I hated to admit it, but—what person, upon receiving the symbols of divine power, would willingly reject the ignorant adoration of the masses?<br><br>I couldn&#39;t do it. I chose to accept it.<br><br>Because I was chosen. Chosen by the gods. And that was divine law.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Another moonlit night. The sky was clear, though heavy clouds passed now and then, dimming the light.<br><br>I bowed my head low, letting the pale glow spill over the ground. The grass was withered—almost dead. Why was it still not raining, even with all these clouds? Why had my rain prayers stopped working?<br><br>Was it because the gods no longer loved them? Then what should I do?<br><br>From far off, I could hear Father and Mother again—arguing, in voices I now knew too well. This wasn’t the first time.。<br><br>And it was always about me.<br><br>When the argument finally died down, I waited. Just like before, they would come to speak with me.<br><br>The door slid open. Two sets of footsteps approached. “Honoka, watching the moon?” Father said gently. “Come here—we want to talk with you about something.”<br><br>“Hm? What is it?” I didn’t turn around. Maybe… I already knew what they were going to say.<br><br>Father came in front of me and knelt down. “I’m sorry… once again, it’s something only you can do. But this time is different… Maybe you’ve already noticed that things have gone beyond our control. And if you decide not to, Honoka—we won’t ask again.”<br><br>“…Something only I can do. You mean the rain prayer, right?”<br><br>Because this wasn’t the first time I’d been asked. Droughts weren’t unusual. The rain would fall eventually. All I had to do was wait.<br><br>“But,” I said, “If the gods have chosen not to send rain… shouldn’t I respect their choice?”<br><br>“Honoka…”<br><br>“They are the gods of cherry blossoms and volcanoes, aren’t they? And that volcano… hasn’t it been dormant for a long time?”<br><br>Silence. The air between us grew still and heavy.<br><br>It had been nearly a year without rain. The villagers had begun to suspect the truth: that the early cherry blossoms blooming at the shrine every spring… were no divine gift. Just a human-made illusion.<br><br>“Dear, maybe we should just leave the village while we still can,” Mother said nervously.<br><br>“You’re right. They’re probably starting to figure things out…” Father’s voice was tight with worry.<br><br>I’d heard lines like that before. But this time… I knew things were different. Their expressions. Their postures. Their voices. The smallest of details told me everything.<br><br>I knew human emotion too well. Too deeply.<br><br>These human feelings…<br><br>“Honoka,” Mother looked at me, eyes full of worry. “Let’s leave the village tonight. Go somewhere far away, okay?”<br><br>“…We’re finally leaving?” I asked.<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“Then who will speak for the gods after that?”<br><br>Mother reached out and caressed my face. Softly, she said, “None of it was ever real, Honoka. It was all a lie.”<br><br>“Then you can leave.” I said.<br><br>She froze. As if the words I spoke weren’t what she expected. Or perhaps… she had feared this answer, but never thought it would truly come.<br><br>“I’ll offer a dance. A prayer—the most sincere I’ve ever given. Just one rain. If the gods chose me to be their voice, then I’ll do what I must.”<br><br>“Honoka…” “…Dear,” Father said behind her. “No matter what happens, I’ll go pack right now.”I heard his footsteps rushing away.<br><br>Paper can’t wrap fire.<br><br>Especially not here—in a shrine built to worship fire itself.<br><br>So what is there left to ask for… in the way of rain?<br><br><br><br><br><br>The rain… was mine.<br><br>It had nothing to do with the gods who once ruled this place.<br><br>Once I understood that, I finally knew what I was.<br><br>I finally understood—who I really was.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I was never just a shrine maiden.</p><hr><h4 id="_1-5-1" tabindex="-1">1.5 <a id="side1-5"></a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-5-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1.5  &lt;a id=&quot;side1-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h4><p>That night, a flickering light glowed outside the gate while chaotic voices rose. I knew then—there wasn’t much time left for my parents to run.<br><br>Mother didn’t call for Father. She simply stumbled to the gate, her trembling fingers barely parting it a crack. The gate was immediately forced wide open. Villagers flooded into our yard, holding torches and farming tools high above their heads.<br><br>“Shrine Maiden! You owe us an explanation tonight!”<br><br>“We’ve offered so much stuff!”<br><br>“If you don’t give us an answer that satisfy us, we’ll burn your house down to the ground!”<br><br>Their eyes were filled with hatred.<br><br>“You insolent fools! Do you mean to rebel against the god?!” I rose to my feet, voice sharp and furious.<br><br>“All we want is a truth! We gave so much! Not a single coin fewer than required, what came in return?! You told us that the rain would come! Sure, it did rain a bit before, how come not a single drop this year?!”<br><br>“I’ve already conveyed the god’s will. The rain will be given at a proper timing.”<br><br>“And we’re just supposed to believe that?! Every year, only your cherry trees bloom! Why won’t the god bless the rest of us?!”<br><br>“Perhaps you should reflect on your own lack of devotion.” How laughable. They probably didn’t even got to know which god they were praying to. “Or are you intended to question the god? The one who blessed this land?”<br><br>“The one who shit on this land! We just want results that we can actually see and touch! Each of us is now deadly starving, these so-called gods—they’re just a scam! A lie! And you’re all liars! Give us back everything we offered!”<br><br>“How a wishful thinking! —&quot;<br><br>A stone sliced across my cheek.<br><br>A flash of pain bloomed. One of them had thrown it. I clutched my bleeding face, scanning the crowd with a glare of fire.<br><br>Mother rushed to me in a panic, pulling me into a tight embrace.<br><br>“You all stop it!” she screamed, “Honoka did nothing wrong! It was us... We lied to her!!” Her voice was breaking with tears.<br><br>I bit my lips. Slowly, I pushed her away.<br><br>“A lie...? She’s never a shrine maiden?!”<br><br>“...Yes, I told her she was Haru-no-Miko, that she could bless everyone... All these years, it was never...”<br><br>“Li… Liar! You deceived all of us!”<br><br>“It’s not her fault! I beg all of you, you can do anything to me, just... please, spare my daughter…”<br><br>Mother fell to her knees, clinging to me, sobbing.<br><br>If I had never agreed to be the shrine maiden... Would none of this have happened?<br><br>But if I had not agreed, I would never have realized I could bring the rain.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Just one rain. What’s so substantial.<br><br>Thick clouds devoured the lonely moon.<br><br>“Silence!” I roared. “This is the sacred Asagi shrine, a lineage blessed by the god for generations! Your defilement is a sin beyond forgiveness. The sky shall judge you!”<br><br>But my voice no longer held deterrence. The chaos only grew louder. They rushed forward with weapons raised.<br><br>I stood my ground. Why should I be afraid? I had never feared them.<br><br>Not since the day I chose to become a shrine maiden. I never feared.<br><br>Because I need to fear nothing.<br><br><br><br><br><br>As I said before: I was never a shrine maiden.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b><span style="color:red;">I, am the God.</span></b><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>“Then… let me pray for every single beings of you. I’ll pray for the rain you crave so desperately.”<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>A cold droplet touched my instep. But it wasn’t Mother’s tears.<br><br>I did not realize what has happened back at that moment, even though I had been thinking about it with every fiber of my being.<br><br>Slowly, in front of the stunned, motionless crowd, I bent down, dipped my fingers in it, tasted it. Filled with sweetness. It was water.<br><br>Rainwater.<br><br>I really was the God who brought this rain.<br><br>A deathly stillness fell—like a divine force had frozen every being in place.<br><br>Until I stood again, arms wide, watched those villagers with a cold smile on my face.<br><br>And next, they lifted their faces, blankly staring into the night sky.<br><br>As if answering my call—the skies opened. Here comes the downpour. All torches were snuffed out in an instant.<br><br>Clothes soaked through their clothes, washing away the dry mud. Drop after drop, endlessly falling.<br><br>“It’s rain!! It’s raining!!” They cried out in bliss. They danced in the water-filled mud, cheering in the downpour.<br><br>“She… She is the real Haru-no-Miko!! The god has answered!! The god has answered!!!” They shouted with utmost joy.<br><br>Just moments ago, they had threatened to burn down my home, to harm me and my parents. Now they knelt before me again, offering reverence, calling me the shrine maiden once more.<br><br>Fools. Pitiful fools.<br><br>However, there’s no need for me to tell them that I was the God.<br><br>Because—it’s not at all necessary.<br><br><br><br><br><br>“Mother, have you seen it? When did you tell which lie at all?”<br><br>I was yet to understand why she averted her eyes.<br><br>Was it due to shame?<br><br><br><br><br><br>Doesn’t matter.<br><br>To my parents. To these ignorant people.<br><br>For I was a god, I owe no one explanation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>During those days, even the fact that this rain never stopped again, was interpreted by me as my divine rage.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Rain, unstopping.<br><br>It was as if the rain meant to repay the drought.<br><br>Floods drowned the seeds and crops.<br><br>Water filled the cracked earth, spilled over, surged into floods. It tore down fences and swept away houses.<br><br>“All the sprouts we worked so hard to grow are gone! Our food stores were also ruined!!”<br><br>“Shrine Maiden! Please—do something!!” They came to me again. Pleading.<br><br>“This is the blessing from god,” I answered. “You must not reject it.”<br><br>“My house is under water! What kind of blessing is this, could your ‘god’ give an explanation?!”<br><br>“I shall plead with the gods,” I said. “Wait quietly.”<br><br>They had begged me for rain. And now, when it really came—they begged me to make it stop instead. Absurd.<br><br>I raised the gohei and began the ritual, as I had done so many times before. Just seeing me do the ceremony always seemed to calm them.<br><br>They stood without talking. Watching.<br><br>Days went by. Nothing changed.<br><br>The patter of raindrops drowned all other sounds out. It was like the sound of my unrelenting rage.<br><br>Ridiculous. How could my own rage escape my control?<br><br><br><br><br><br>…Or so I told myself.<br><br><br><br></p><hr><h4 id="_1-6-1" tabindex="-1">1.6 <a id="side1-6"></a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-6-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1.6  &lt;a id=&quot;side1-6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The torches would no longer catch fire.<br><br>But farming tools were mostly forged from metal.<br><br>Lately, things had only grown worse. The rain showed no sign of stopping. Some who were caught in it had collapsed, slipping into unconsciousness. They tried everything to wake them, but nothing worked.<br><br>As if their lives had quietly been taken away.<br><br>As if this rain was drawing life from them to feed the cherry blossoms.<br><br>The cherry trees had finally blossomed. They were late, but now they blanketed the mountains. The rain tapped against the delicate petals. Another villager fell. This rain was giving life, but it took away the purpose of it.<br><br>Those who touched the rain vanished like scattered cherry petals. It was not quite death in the usual sense, but with trivial differences.<br><br>Because next spring will arrive on time. But this spring, this very spring, would truly come to an ending.<br><br>Terrified, they gathered in our courtyard, begging me to stop the rain.<br><br>“This must be for our disrespect toward the gods!!”<br><br>“My husband was soaked and never woke up! This rain must be divine punishment!!”<br><br>“Please, Shrine Maiden! Beg the god’s mercy to stop this rain!!”<br><br>Driven by panic, the villagers flooded into my house. Even though they, too, had gotten wet from the rain.<br><br>Even though they, too, had no escape.<br><br>Father and Mother tried to block them out, but two mortal beings could not stop a full crowd.<br><br>Nearly the entire village had gathered in our yard.<br><br>They surrounded me, knelt down, clinging to my legs, begging.<br><br>Mother once held my legs that same way.<br><br>I’d had enough of them. When I met their wishes, they worshipped me. The moment I failed them, they cursed me, turned on me. There was nothing left in them worth saving.<br><br>I looked at them serenely, unmoved by their grief. “This is my wrath. Your retribution,” I said.<br><br>“Wh...what...?” they stared at me, stunned.<br><br>I wanted to care no more and turned to leave.<br><br>“...You… you’re not a shrine maiden at all! You’re a heretic! A cursed child after all! We’ll offer you to the true god and end their rage!!” Someone among them shouted out to me.<br><br>At once, the others followed. They grabbed at me. Tore my clothes. Screamed of sacrifice.<br><br>I gave it a laugh.<br><br>“That’s right. I was never a shrine maiden.” I opened my arms, as I had when this rain first began. I embraced their curses. Embraced the warm, freezing rain, “I am Asagi Honoka. I am the God of rain.”<br><br>That was the moment the riot began. Just like that previous night.<br><br>They meant to kill me. Father and Mother swung extinguished torches, trying to hold them back.<br><br>“Ignorant fools. Kill me so this land will never see rain again. You all will face eternal drought. The crops will die. The blossoms will wither. All life will fall! Have you thought twice before doing so?”<br><br>“What a load of nonsense, kill her! She’s gone nothing but insane!”<br><br>“She uses those arms for rituals—cut off her hands first!!”<br><br>In the chaos, a pitchfork struck my abdomen. My brow tightened while the pain bloomed sharp.<br><br>“Lowly mortals... do you even grasp the sin you have committed?!” Still, I did not lower my arms. Such small pain could be endured. I am a God, my death would bring only ruin.<br><br>And that was enough. I longed to see the rain flood them all. Even if it comes with the fall of my deity.<br><br>But right at that next moment... From my side, a sudden force struck me.<br><br>That force went far greater than the mob. I couldn’t tell what emotion it carried. I hadn’t wasted my time understanding human feelings for a long time.<br><br>“Run! Honoka!”<br><br>Before I stumbled backward, I caught a glimpse through the villagers to distinguish the source of that push.<br><br>It was my mother.<br><br>The next second, she died before my eyes.<br><br>Maybe the pain in my stomach had finally broken through the mask of adrenaline, or maybe it was simply the rainwater being too cold. But something inside me broke through.<br><br>And I remembered how to cry. I didn’t know why I cried. There was nothing left to cry for.<br><br>My body moved anyway, driven by instinct alone. Step by step, I fled toward the inner shrine. There…if I could make it past the back door, into the forest, no one would be able to follow me there.<br><br>Blood still poured from my abdomen, painting a deep red trail across the road, the stairs, the floor.<br><br>&quot;This is the price we called down upon ourselves. Honoka, for a time, we lived better than most. But still... I regret not giving you a future worthy of you.&quot;<br><br>Beneath the villagers’ attacks, Father struck a match in silence. He tossed it into the pile of kindling prepared long ago. Even in the rain, the flames bloomed, slowly consumed the shrine.<br><br>We had already faced doubt and torches—and now it was our own hands that burned away the past we obtained.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I had lost count of how many times I fell to the ground. My shrine maiden’s robes were torn to ribbons by branches and stone. The bleeding from my abdomen wouldn’t stop. It spilled into the land, mingling with the rainwater. Pale pink ripples spread across the puddles.<br><br>Within those ripples, I ignored the mud clinging to my body, trying to wipe the rain away from my vision. I kept fleeing forward, though my feet no longer knew straight lines.<br><br>The rain struck without mercy. The wounds hurt so much. I had scraped and gashed myself too many times. My strength was leaving me.<br><br>And before long, I realized that the blur in my vision wasn’t caused by rain alone. It was my mind unable to support my body. What little energy I had left. I supposed that the drowsiness carried by this rain was affecting me without distinction. Under both pressures, there was not much time left for me.<br><br>It was then I leaned against a cherry tree.<br><br>Slowly, I lifted my gaze. On branches that had once stood bare, fragile pink petals now bloomed. Its beauty stole my breath.<br><br>They were real petals.<br><br>Nobody crafted any lie.<br><br>No one suffered any sorrowness.<br><br>As lovely as they were short-lived. Just like the reflection of my whole life.<br><br>I had always loved the rain. Even as a child, I loved the rain most of all.<br><br>And yet, I had been given so few chances to meet its season.<br><br>Now, I have more rain than I could ever wish for.<br><br><br><br><br><br>So that was it... The young girl I used to be truly did love the rain.<br><br>I nearly forgot about it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It’s cold.<br><br>And yet how warm it was. How warm the rainwater was.<br><br>In this moment, I danced beneath the rain.<br><br>Even in this fragile body, my arms still raised the gohei. I had brought it all this way. That alone surprised me.<br><br>Pink petals drifted with the light rain, falling, fading. Amid their gentle descent, I offered my final dance. What a splendid celebration it was.<br><br>If this was to be the last bloom, I would accept it—with grace.<br><br>I knew every single tiny step of the ritual. Though I fell again and again, I rose each time, keeping the dance flowing within me.<br><br>This dance was mine alone. My last offering to the God.<br><br><br><br><br><br>All the words of mortals... will be woven into a melody of rain.<br><br>Reflecting in pale-red ripples, remains the pipe dream of a girl named “Asagi Honoka”.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Within this momentary spring, petals circling me like drifting ghosts. I stepped through the last movements of my ritual prayer.<br><br>I raised my hands skyward, as if to hold onto something.<br><br>—Beneath the cherry blossoms, a divine dance of elegance and grandeur.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>“Mmm...”<br><br>“Bad dream?”<br><br>From a tattered bed among crumbling ruins, the white-haired girl stirred from sleep.<br><br>“I do not really recall the content,” she was expressionless like usual, “Just... I think there were flowers.”<br><br>“Sounds like a good dream instead.”<br><br>“A good one?... I’m yet to understand them.” Outside the window, the rain whispered down in sparse, gentle drops. “And the flowers... they were pretty.”<br><br>“Shall we try growing some flowers, too?”<br><br>“Grow flowers?”<br><br>“There’s no one else traveling with us anyway. We could gather seeds, see if we can bring back flowers that are almost gone from this world.”<br><br>The girl gave a slow, uncertain nod.<br><br>“I will try.”</p><hr><h2 id="collaboration" tabindex="-1">COLLABORATION <a id="Collaboration"></a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#collaboration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;COLLABORATION &lt;a id=&quot;Collaboration&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="rain-world" tabindex="-1">Rain World <a id="rainworld"></a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#rain-world" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Rain World &lt;a id=&quot;rainworld&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="_0-1-1" tabindex="-1">0.1 <a id="rainworld0-1"></a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_0-1-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;0.1  &lt;a id=&quot;rainworld0-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h4><p>76936.7085.17 - Public Channel DM to Local Group<br><br>DM: Triple affirmative!

My best friend just got swallowed by the rampant overflow of rain.<br><br>He was the last one remaining from his rescue team.<br><br>Now, all members of the three rescue teams have all perished.<br><br>The temperature in the underground area is now extremely high. The industrial production zone has been submerged.

I always knew that.<br><br>Entering the command to open the floodgate was a complete mistake. But we had no other choice at then.

It&#39;s been 4 days since the floodgate connecting Section B unexpectedly closed due to system errors.<br><br>No one knows exactly what&#39;s wrong with the system — there are no answers yet. Anyway, the fact that nobody has tried to open the door from the outside for so many days suggests that people outside Section C might be facing some tricky problems too.<br><br>The maintenance workers are still attempting to establish communication with the control room of the industrial production area. Currently, Section C is in an isolated state.<br><br>We all know that the floodgate can&#39;t be opened.

There&#39;s no sound coming from inside the pipes anymore, and the water gauge hasn&#39;t budged in a long time.<br><br>This probably means that the rainwater, which should have been flowing through Section C, has come to a halt. We&#39;re not sure if it&#39;s because the rain outside has stopped or… if there&#39;s any problem with the pipeline system.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Of course, we wouldn&#39;t hope for the latter. But we&#39;re not really sure the former is worth celebrating, either.<br><br>At least for me, I&#39;m just not ready for any changes to come so soon… yet.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Section C is still in isolation. The floodgate remains unscratched, and even our most sophisticated equipment can only manage to shave off a thin layer of metal debris from that door.<br><br>What on earth is wrong with DM?

It&#39;s hard to imagine what kind of emergency could make our people abandon their food and flee empty-handed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The two floodgates in this area are tightly shut as well. They would originally lead to Section A, where the metal synthesis chain is located, and our previous location, Section C.<br><br>Section D is vertically connected to the transportation area via a lift, but it seems the power to the lift has been cut off, and we can&#39;t get to the upper floor.

Japheth said it&#39;s just the condensation unit operating. I feel a subtle sense of disquiet creeping up on me at that noise.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Charlene shows up. She says there&#39;s a spare route in Section D leading to the water reservoir. We tell her it&#39;s best not to try to get anywhere near the rain right now, but that it would be our last resort to the upper floor.<br><br>Staying underground is clearly the safest bet. At least, if things have gone south down here, people closer to the surface won&#39;t know how bad it really is.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Charlene and Japheth head to the reservoir through the route anyway, leaving the rest of us in Section D.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Shortly after the two of them left, a deafening biochemical alarm erupts, filling the entire production area.<br><br>The gates connecting other Sections suddenly open.<br><br><br><br><br><br>People from Section A flee towards us.<br><br>Behind them is <i>rainwater</i>.

About 13 days ago, I found a way to bypass the restrictions. Immediately, I secretly allocated 30% of the neural network for testing. The initial and secondary test results were promising. The plan seemed flawless.<br><br>DM: However, shortly after the plan was officially implemented, I inadvertently disrupted several hibernation commands while circumventing the restrictions. It seemed harmless at the time. But I made a severe, irreversible error in my basic logic, causing a complete deadlock in a small portion of the neural network and an immediate failure of the temperature control system.<br><br>DM: I promptly severed those networks and attempted to partially restore temperature regulation and water circulation. Unfortunately, the crucial reference data for controlling the drainage system was stored in the neural network, which is completely halted. I made a wrong decision — a series of wrong decisions, rather — that led me into this predicament. The process of circumventing the restrictions generated a significant amount of slag, which I need to flush out of my structure using rainwater.<br><br>DM: The shelter&#39;s drainage has been malfunctioning for the past 7 days. To prevent the water level in the reservoir from overflowing into the industrial production area, I used the maximum authority of this shelter to close all floodgates in the production area.<br><br>DM: But my situation is now dire. The microbial layer of the structure has severely overheated, and the irreversible damage to the neural network still continues. I am trapped in my own tin can with only two options: do nothing or do what I must. But the latter is gradually losing its meaning. I am on the brink of losing control.<br><br>DM: I suspect the communication array&#39;s signal still hasn&#39;t been restored, but I will still attempt to broadcast this message to the local group. To any iterators who receive this broadcast, I implore you to send a reliable rescue team to my shelter.

She likes to hide in such places, cabinets so small that even a cat can&#39;t fit.<br><br>No one. No one&#39;s in the bedroom. The girl rushes out to search, almost turning the entire house upside down. No. No. <i>No.</i> She can&#39;t find Note anywhere. Not under the bed in the bedroom, not in the oven in the kitchen, not under the counter in the bathroom. Where on earth could she be?<br><br>A thought suddenly crosses her mind. <i>If she&#39;s not inside the house, then she must be outside.</i> Without thinking twice, this anxious girl puts on her shoes at the entrance, opens the door, and rushes out, completely ignoring the falling rain.<br><br>The sound of rain fills the air. It continues to fall. It relentlessly falls. Its icy-cold droplets soaking the girl, turning her thoughts into a puddle.</p><hr><h4 id="_2" tabindex="-1">2 <a id="notanote-2"></a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2  &lt;a id=&quot;notanote-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The patter of rain fills the air as darkness surrounds her. Raindrops fall on her, stinging slightly, until a large one lands on her eyelids, prompting the girl to realize she had been tightly shut her eyes.<br><br>So she opens them again. Then — she&#39;s greeted by a scene that leaves her speechless. Skyscrapers, like steel forests, rise from the water — reeds made of concrete and steel, it seems. The buildings stand tall, submerged in the water, as if the whole world has turned into a pond.<br><br>Startled, she takes a step back, only to stumble over something on the ground, sending her tumbling down. She finds herself on the rooftop of a building, its corroded cooling pipes causing her fall. The impact has ruptured the pipe, and hot steam shoots out accompanied by a sharp hiss.<br><br>“Where… where am I?”<br><br>Rain continues to mercilessly soak her, drenching the clothes she&#39;d just neatly prepared. She sits in the rain, her knees pulled to her chest, feeling helpless and lost, wanting to cry.<br><br>“Nota? Good—morning!” A voice comes from behind her, as its owner embraces her, greeting her as cheerful as always. “What are you doing sitting in the rain?” She asks.<br><br>“No… Note? What are you doing here too?”<br><br>“Huh? Isn&#39;t it like the usual? I&#39;ve always been around. Come on, get up from the ground, you might catch a cold!” Note props up a large umbrella, sheltering them both from the rain&#39;s onslaught. Fortunately, the downpour hides the tears threatening to fall from her eyes, shielding them from Note&#39;s view.<br><br>Note helps Nota to her feet, and they both realize their clothes are soaked through.<br><br>“Look at you! You&#39;re like a drowned rat!” Note laughs.<br><br>“Hello? Pot, kettle. Your white hair looks like a mop,” Nota retorts.<br><br>The two of them laugh, as if even this downpour has softened in their presence.<br><br>Note leads Nota into the building, shutting the door behind them, blocking out the sound of rain. The echoing clatter instantly turns into a faint hum.<br><br>“Didn&#39;t expect to run into you while fixing the heater on the rooftop,” Note remarks.<br><br>“I didn&#39;t expect… you here… I mean, where is this anyway?” Nota tries to divert the conversation, realizing she might be the one responsible for breaking the heater.<br><br>“Here? Hmm… it&#39;s some kind of the &#39;colorless world,&#39; they called. I ended up here out of the blue too. For the rest, you&#39;ll see for yourself later.”<br><br>Following Note, Nota descends two floors. The corridor is mostly abandoned, cluttered with debris, yet there&#39;re no signs of any human traces. Trying to find a silver lining, she figures she won&#39;t have to worry about property prices anymore, if it&#39;s still worth anything.<br><br>Noticing a plastic vase lying across the hallway, Nota suddenly realizes that everything she sees appears to be in black and white. Though the patterns on the vase have faded, they should not have turned black and gray. Glancing at a landscape painting piled on a cardboard box nearby, she finds it equally monochrome.<br><br>“Note, why is everything… black and white?” Nota asks.<br><br>“Well… it&#39;s the &#39;colorless world,&#39; after all. No color, just how it goes,” Note replies.<br><br>While Note seems to accept this absurd sight, it&#39;s the first time they&#39;ve seen a world truly devoid of color.<br><br>Approaching a door, there&#39;s nothing remarkable about it. No nameplate, no unique decorations. Just a plain wooden door, with a simple metal knob. Nota recalls, this seems to be the only room in the building with a closed door.<br><br>“Curious about what&#39;s behind the door?” Note grins mischievously.<br><br>“…Hope it&#39;s nothing scary…”<br><br>“Not telling you. If you want to know, open the door yourself.” With a swift move, Note darts behind Nota, pushing her towards the door.<br><br>The round knob sits quietly, waiting to be grasped and turned. Nota swallows nervously, extends her hand, grabs the knob, and twists it to the right.</p><hr><h4 id="_3" tabindex="-1">3 <a id="notanote-3"></a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3  &lt;a id=&quot;notanote-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The wooden door swings open, revealing the scene behind it.<br><br>Before anything else, a strong gust of wind hits them. Where there should be a row of glass walls, there&#39;s nothing but emptiness. Irregular damages mark the edges, and the ceiling is missing, as if something indescribable had taken a bite out of the room&#39;s perimeter.<br><br>And in this room, there&#39;s someone else. A girl stands at the edge, with no glass walls to block the pouring rain. It falls straight onto the edge of the room, wetting the ground, yet the girl seems unfazed. She stands there, her clothes billowing in the wind, her silver-white hair dancing along. Nota peers closer, surprised to find that the downpour hasn&#39;t soaked her.<br><br>“That girl…?” Nota blurts out.<br><br>“Not just her. Check around.”<br><br>Reminded by Note, she looks around and sees another “girl” squatting in the corner of the room. Dressed in shades of black, white, and gray, with notably fluffy ears typically found only on feline animals, the “girl” sits beside a small makeshift house assembled from wood planks, canvas, iron pieces, and duct tape.<br><br>“That house! I built it. Pretty cool, isn&#39;t it?” Nota isn&#39;t particularly proud of the peculiar structure, especially with her attention fixed on the other two girls.<br><br>Approaching the squatting kid, Nota bends down and asks in a gentle tone, “Um… do you… know what&#39;s happening here?”<br><br>They stare at the floor without responding.<br><br>“Uh…” Nota feels awkward. “So… um… what&#39;s your name?”<br><br>“Kino.” This time, she gets a clear answer from <i>him</i>, although barely audible.<br><br>“Kino… that&#39;s a nice name.” Nota tries to continue the conversation, but Kino seems uninterested.<br><br>Regardless of what she says next, Kino doesn&#39;t respond further.<br><br>Facing a dead end, she decides to try another approach. Nota moves to the girl standing in the rain, the howling winds making her a bit fearful. She feels like she could be swept into the air by a gust of wind at any moment, but the girl in front of her stands unfazed.<br><br>“…Sorry! Um, what&#39;s your name?” Nota has to shout to ensure her voice isn&#39;t drowned out by the storm.<br><br>The girl turns to face Nota, her expression blank and stiff, like a doll.<br><br>“I… don&#39;t understand,” the doll says, her deep blue eyes fixed on Nota.<br><br>“What… a name… is…?” Nota is bewildered by the enigmatic girl. “It&#39;s, um… what people call you…”<br><br>“… Sorry.”<br><br>The conversation reaches a dead end. Again. Nota never expected to hit such a brick wall. Meanwhile, Note stands by, seemingly unsurprised.<br><br>“I asked them the same thing when I found them,” says Note. “Nothing came out. Well… not exactly <i>nothing</i>. After watching them for about, um, one… two… three… four… five,” she counts, “— five months, it&#39;s clear that <i>Kino</i> is the central figure of this world.”<br><br>“Huh…? What do you mean by &#39;central&#39;…?” Nota was hoping for some Sherlock-style deduction, where they piece together some clues and peculiarities to arrive at a surprising answer. But instead, Note just bluntly throws out the conclusion.<br><br>“Well, haven&#39;t you noticed what sets Kino apart from us?”<br><br>“What… sets him apart?”<br><br>“Take a closer look at him. He&#39;s just as <i>colorless</i> as this world!”<br><br>“Ah…? I thought…”<br><br>“You thought it was just his fashion choice, didn&#39;t you? Of course not, Silly!”<br><br>“Oh… I see — ah… Achoo!” Suddenly feeling the chill creeping into her body, Nota realizes she&#39;s just been caught in the rain. The surreal visual spectacle from moments ago made her forget about her other senses, and now she&#39;s in danger of catching a cold.<br><br>“Um… I&#39;ll go make a fire to dry off. Your clothes are practically see-through now.” Of course, Note is teasing her. With a double layer of protection from her jacket and shirt, there&#39;s no way her clothes could be that translucent. Despite this, Nota instinctively tightens her clothes.</p><hr><h4 id="_4" tabindex="-1">4 <a id="notanote-4"></a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4  &lt;a id=&quot;notanote-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The monochromatic flames blaze, crackling softly. The mixture of wooden planks and protein fiber cloth emits a not-so-pleasant smell when burned, but at least it dries both of their clothes.<br><br>Sitting by the fire, Nota leans against it, feeling the warmth. Note sits beside her, gazing at the crackling fire.<br><br>“Hey, Note, how long do you think we&#39;ll be stuck in this space?” Nota asks.<br><br>“Don&#39;t know, a lifetime, maybe.” Note replies, teasingly.<br><br>“… No, that can&#39;t be.”<br><br>“You actually believed that?” Note chuckles. “Once we fix the root of the problem, we should be able to go back, I guess.”<br><br>“You guess… you&#39;re not sure either!”<br><br>“—Anyway! I guess that&#39;s how it&#39;ll be! Gotta have something to look forward to, you know.”<br><br>“Yeah… Ugh! I don&#39;t want to think about it anymore! So many weird things in one day! I&#39;m <i>so</i> hungry. Let&#39;s cook something to eat.” Nota volunteers to take charge of their meals. But as soon as she says that, she faces a dilemma. Where in <i>this</i> abandoned building can she find ingredients? Nowhere seems like a place to find fresh produce. She looks at the edge of the gap and vaguely sees moss growing on the concrete—still black and white, but clearly organic.<br><br>The girl beside her stands quietly, gazing into the distance. Nota wonders what she&#39;s looking at, or what she&#39;s been thinking. The doll-like girl hears rustling noises nearby, turns her head, and sees Nota collecting lichen growing on the concrete.<br><br>Nota notices the girl looking at her and shows a slightly embarrassed expression. “Um… I&#39;m gathering food.”<br><br>“What&#39;s a &#39;food&#39;?”<br><br>“Food… food is something you can eat to fill your belly.”<br><br>“Can you fill your belly with this?” the girl asks, picking up a brick.<br><br>“Uh… that&#39;s probably… not edible…?” Nota rushes over to stop her as the girl seems genuinely about to put the entire brick into her mouth. <i>She&#39;s a strange one.</i> Nota thinks to herself.<br><br>Nota puts the lichen into a can she found and wanders around other rooms, gathering mushrooms. However, because she can&#39;t distinguish colors, she only picks those that look safe at first glance—<i>probably</i> safe.<br><br>The fire is still burning, and Nota has Note set up a makeshift stand. They collect rainwater in the can to wash the food. The one thing not lacking in this place is <i>water</i>. They place the can on the stand, letting the flames of the fire heat the water. When the water starts to bubbling and steaming, Nota carefully takes the can down and scoops out the cooked food into four bowls, using a <i>dessert spoon</i> as a makeshift ladle.<br><br>Note takes the soup generously and eats it happily. The girl in the rain takes a bowl of soup, looking puzzled as raindrops fall into it, splashing. Nota has to explain to her how to eat it and how to use the spoon.<br><br>Finally, Nota brings the soup to Kino. She crouches down and places a bowl of soup in Kino&#39;s hand. Kino looks up at her. Nota smiles, gesturing for him to try it while it&#39;s hot. Kino cradles the bowl carefully, takes a sip.<br><br>“It&#39;s… warm.”<br><br>“Ha, that&#39;s for sure. Is it good?”<br><br>“…Mm.”<br><br>“Phew… that&#39;s good… I was worried it would taste awful…”<br><br>“It&#39;s delicious. It&#39;s been… so long since I&#39;ve had something like this…”<br><br>“I see… so, how long have you been here?”<br><br>“…don&#39;t know… I&#39;ve been here for a long time…”<br><br>“Ah, I see…”<br><br>Kino falls silent and sips the hot soup in his hands. Although they haven&#39;t managed to chat about anything substantial, the fact that Kino is willing to talk now is a huge encouragement for Nota.<br><br>Outside the rain continues unabated, but inside the room, it&#39;s warm thanks to the crackling fire and these bowls of hot soup.<br><br>Nota returns to the fire, about to take a sip from the pot, when Note pulls her outside.<br><br>“Hey, did you notice any changes in Kino?”<br><br>“Huh? What changes?”<br><br>“You&#39;re really slow, aren&#39;t you? You were sitting right in front of him. Guess it&#39;s true what they say about being too close to see?”<br><br>“Quit stalling, what changes?”<br><br>“When you were feeding him soup, didn&#39;t you notice colors flickering around him?”<br><br>“Really…? I didn&#39;t notice it at all…”<br><br>“Well, if you missed it, you missed it. But thanks to that, I&#39;ve got an idea, and I need you to gather these materials for me…” Note rattles off a long list of items, so long that Nota has to jot them down on paper.<br><br>After a while, Nota manages to collect all the materials Note requested, filling up a heavy bag. As Nota hands the bag over to Note, the latter is already tinkering away with the tools.<br><br>“Wow, you found everything much faster than I thought! Looks like you have a talent for picking up sticks, huh?”<br><br>“Do you really have to praise people like that? I can&#39;t even distinguish the colors of those things. It&#39;s annoying, you know.”<br><br>“But you still managed to find everything.” Note takes the bag, rummaging through the odd assortment of materials, and gets to work. “Go take a break. You&#39;ve been busy all day.”<br><br>“Oh… alright.” Nota finds a clean spot against the wall and sits down. The rain outside patters softly, while the warmth of the crackling fire gradually seeps into her bodies, lulling the girl into a sudden wave of drowsiness.</p><hr><h4 id="_5" tabindex="-1">5 <a id="notanote-5"></a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_5" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;5  &lt;a id=&quot;notanote-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Eventually, Nota is shaken awake. “Wake up!” It&#39;s Note&#39;s voice. “I did it!”<br><br>“Huh…? What…?”<br><br>A large box is pushed in front of Nota. “Here it is. Took me quite an effort.”<br><br>Nota looks at the box skeptically. “Is it really going to work…?”<br><br>“Won&#39;t know until we try, right? Worst case, we&#39;ll just keep being stuck here forever.”<br><br>“Sounds like you&#39;re totally winging it…”<br><br>“Alright, alright, if it doesn&#39;t work, I&#39;m gonna blame you for jinxing it with all your talk. Now, take it up to the roof and set it up while I go and grab Kino and the other girl.”<br><br>“Is this thing waterproof?”<br><br>“I&#39;ve thought of that, rest assured. It can&#39;t be ruined by a little rain!”<br><br>“Fine…”<br><br>The box is too big for Nota to carry or hold, so she ends up pushing it all the way to the roof. Opening her umbrella, she pushes the box to an open space. By this time, the other three have also arrived on the roof.<br><br>“Okay—” Note shouts at Nota, waving her hands.<br><br>“Can this really work…?” Nota mumbles to herself again. But at this point, she figures they have nothing else to lose.<br><br>Nota takes out a lighter, ignites the fuse.<br><br><i>Hiss…</i><br><br>The fuse burns down. A wisp of smoke rises, followed by the rhythmic sound of rain.<br><br>“What? Is it broken…? It was supposed to be…” Nota bends down to inspect when a beam of light shoots out from the box.<br><br><i>Whoosh—boom!!!</i><br><br>Nota is startled and falls to the ground. A firework explodes in the sky.<br><br>Nota and Note both turn their attention to Kino.<br><br>“…?” Kino looks up at the fireworks in the sky, crackling sounds still echoing, as more fireworks appear one after another.<br><br>“Fireworks…” Kino murmurs softly. “So beautiful…”<br><br>The fireworks in the sky suddenly gain color. Brilliant hues form blooming flowers, one after another, creating a spectacle unique to the four of them.<br><br>Kino&#39;s umbrella falls to the ground. Note goes to pick it up, but notices the rain diminishing and feels the cold drops turning warm, like spring rain approaching.<br><br>“Note, look! The colors of those plants! They are getting back!” Nota points to the vines on the building&#39;s side.<br><br>“It seems like it worked.”<br><br>“Yeah! And… oh, your body… it&#39;s becoming transparent too…”<br><br>“… Yours too. Are we about to leave? I&#39;m just starting to enjoy this place.”<br><br>“You can&#39;t be serious right now.”<br><br>Note chuckles. “Just kidding. Isn&#39;t it better to return to our own world?”<br><br>“Yeah… I suppose so.”<br><br>“And I believe it&#39;s time to bid farewell to our two friends.”<br><br>“Right…”<br><br>Nota and Note wave to Kino and the other girl.<br><br>The next moment, Nota finds herself lying on the street in front of their house, with Note pressing down on her.<br><br>“You&#39;re going to crush me! Get off!” Nota protests.<br><br>“Sorry, this wasn&#39;t what I intended!”<br><br>“My clothes… they&#39;re all wet again…”<br><br>“Hurry, get inside and change before you catch a cold!”<br><br>Hot water flows from the showerhead, washing away the cold and fatigue. Nota suddenly remembers that she never got to taste the soup. But judging by Kino&#39;s final smile, it must have been good, right?<br><br>Outside, the rain has stopped.</p>',133))])}const v=l(u,[["render",c]]);export{k as __pageData,v as default};
